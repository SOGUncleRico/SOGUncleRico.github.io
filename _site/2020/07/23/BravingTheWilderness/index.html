          <blockquote>
  <p>Even in the context of suffering—poverty, violence, human rights violations—not belonging in<br />
our families is still one of the most dangerous hurts. That’s because it has the power to break our<br />
heart, our spirit, and our sense of self-worth. It broke all three for me. And when those things break,<br />
there are only three outcomes, something I’ve borne witness to in my life and in my work:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You live in constant pain and seek relief by numbing it and/or inflicting it on others;</li>
    <li>You deny your pain, and your denial ensures that you pass it on to those around you and down to your children; or</li>
    <li>You find the courage to own the pain and develop a level of empathy and compassion for yourself and others that allows you to spot hurt in the world in a unique way.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I look back, I realize I probably owe my career to not belonging. First as a child, then as a teenager, I found my primary coping mechanism for not belonging in studying people. I was a seeker of pattern and connection. I knew if I could recognize patterns in people’s behaviors and connect those patterns to what people were feeling and doing, I could find my way. I used my pattern recognition skills to anticipate what people wanted, what they thought, or what they were doing. I learned how to say the right thing or show up in the right way. I became an expert fitter-in, a chameleon. And a very lonely stranger to myself. As time passed, I grew to know many of the people around me better than they knew themselves, but in that process, I lost me.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>During my parents’ ongoing and worsening fights, my brother and two sisters would usually<br />
come into my room to wait it out. As the oldest, I started using my newly formed fitting-in<br />
superpowers to identify what had led to the fighting, so I could concoct elaborate interventions to<br />
“make things better.” I could be the savior for my siblings, for my family. When it worked, I<br />
considered myself a hero. When it didn’t, I’d blame myself and double down on the data finding. It’s<br />
only just dawning on me as I write this—this is actually when I started choosing research and data<br />
over vulnerability.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m doing that thing I do when I’m afraid. I’m floating above my life, watching it and<br />
studying it, rather than living it.”<br />
Murdoch nodded. “I know. But you need to find a way to stop and bring yourself back here. This<br />
is a big deal. I don’t want you to miss it. Don’t study this moment. Be in it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because<br />
this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking<br />
approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it.<br />
Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect<br />
selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of<br />
self-acceptance.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes, we are different in many ways, but under it all we’re deeply connected.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re going to need to intentionally be with people who are different from us. We’re going to<br />
have to sign up, join, and take a seat at the table. We’re going to have to learn how to listen, have hard<br />
conversations, look for joy, share pain, and be more curious than defensive, all while seeking<br />
moments of togetherness.<br />
True belonging is not passive. It’s not the belonging that comes with just joining a group. It’s not<br />
fitting in or pretending or selling out because it’s safer. It’s a practice that requires us to be<br />
vulnerable, get uncomfortable, and learn how to be present with people without sacrificing who we<br />
are. We want true belonging, but it takes tremendous courage to knowingly walk into hard moments.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <h5 id="trusting-others-braving">TRUSTING OTHERS (BRAVING)</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Boundaries — You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not clear about what’s okay and not okay, you ask. You’re willing to say no.</li>
    <li>Reliability — You do what you say you’ll do. This means staying aware of your competencies and limitations so you don’t overpromise and are able to deliver on commitments and balance competing priorities.</li>
    <li>Accountability — You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends.</li>
    <li>Vault — You don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share. I need to know that my confidences are kept, and that you’re not sharing with me any information about other people that<br />
should be confidential.</li>
    <li>Integrity — You choose courage over comfort. You choose what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy. And you choose to practice your values rather than simply professing them.</li>
    <li>Nonjudgment — I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for what you need. We can talk about how we feel without judgment.</li>
    <li>Generosity — You extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Joseph Campbell wrote, “If you can see your path laid out in front of you step by step, you know it’s not your path. Your own path you make with every step you take. That’s why it’s your path.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The quest for true belonging begins with this definition that I crafted from the data. It will serve as a touchstone as we move through the work together:<br />
True belonging is the spiritual practice of believing in and belonging to yourself so deeply that you can share your most authentic self with the world and find sacredness in both being a part of something and standing alone in the wilderness. True belonging doesn’t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we hear someone else sing about the jagged edges of heartache or the unspeakable nature of grief, we immediately know we’re not the only ones in pain. The transformative power of art is in this sharing. Without connection or collective engagement, what we hear is simply a caged song of sorrow and despair; we find no liberation in it. It’s the sharing of art that whispers, “You’re not alone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As a result, we now live in a giant feedback loop, hearing<br />
our own thoughts about what’s right and wrong bounced back to us by the television shows we watch, the newspapers and books we read, the blogs we visit online, the sermons we hear, and the neighborhoods we live in.”<br />
This sorting leads us to make assumptions about the people around us, which in turn fuels<br />
disconnection.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The neuroscience researcher John Cacioppo of the University of Chicago has been studying<br />
loneliness for over twenty years. He defines loneliness as “perceived social isolation.” We<br />
experience loneliness when we feel disconnected. Maybe we’ve been pushed to the outside of a group that we value, or maybe we’re lacking a sense of true belonging. At the heart of loneliness is the absence of meaningful social interaction—an intimate relationship, friendships, family gatherings, or even community or work group connections.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s important to note that loneliness and being alone are very different things. Being alone or<br />
inhabiting solitude can be a powerful and healing thing. As an introvert, I deeply value alone time,<br />
and I often feel the loneliest when I’m with other people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While there’s deep alignment between what I’ve found in my research and what Cacioppo has<br />
found, it wasn’t until I processed his work that I fully understood the important role loneliness plays<br />
in our lives. He explains that as members of a social species, we don’t derive strength from our<br />
rugged individualism, but rather from our collective ability to plan, communicate, and work together.<br />
Our neural, hormonal, and genetic makeup support interdependence over independence. He explains,<br />
“To grow to adulthood as a social species, including humans, is not to become autonomous and<br />
solitary, it’s to become the one on whom others can depend. Whether we know it or not, our brain and<br />
biology have been shaped to favor this outcome.” Of course we’re a social species. That’s why<br />
connection matters. It’s why shame is so painful and debilitating. It’s why we’re wired for belonging.<br />
Cacioppo explains how the biological machinery of our brains warns us when our ability to<br />
thrive and prosper is threatened. Hunger is a warning that our blood sugar is low and we need to eat.<br />
Thirst warns us that we need to drink to avoid dehydration. Pain alerts us to potential tissue damage.<br />
And loneliness tells us that we need social connection—something as critical to our well-being as<br />
food and water. He explains, “Denying you feel lonely makes no more sense than denying you feel<br />
hunger.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unchecked loneliness fuels continued loneliness by keeping us afraid to reach out.<br />
To combat loneliness, we must first learn how to identify it and to have the courage to see that<br />
experience as a warning sign. Our response to that warning sign should be to find connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What if what we experience close up is real, and what we hear on the news and from the mouths<br />
of politicians who are jockeying for power needs to be questioned? It is not easy to hate people close<br />
up. And when we are in pain and fear, anger and hate are our go-to emotions. Almost everyone I’ve<br />
ever interviewed or known will tell you that it’s easier to be pissed off than it is to be hurt or scared.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes owning our pain and bearing witness to struggle means getting angry. When we deny<br />
ourselves the right to be angry, we deny our pain. There are a lot of coded shame messages in the<br />
rhetoric of “Why so hostile?” “Don’t get hysterical,” “I’m sensing so much anger!” and “Don’t take it<br />
so personally.” All of these responses are normally code for Your emotion or opinion is making me<br />
uncomfortable or Suck it up and stay quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Courage is forged in pain, but not in all pain. Pain that is denied or ignored becomes fear or<br />
hate. Anger that is never transformed becomes resentment and bitterness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Participants who put true belonging into practice talked openly about their boundaries. In fact,<br />
this research confirmed what I found in my earlier work: The clearer and more respected the<br />
boundaries, the higher the level of empathy and compassion for others. Fewer clear boundaries, less<br />
openness. It’s hard to stay kind-hearted when you feel people are taking advantage of you or<br />
threatening you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the courage to be vulnerable, and the willingness to practice our BRAVING skills,<br />
moving closer means we need tools for navigating conflict.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But when we avoid certain conversations, and never fully learn how the other person feels about all of the issues, we sometimes end up making assumptions that not only perpetuate but deepen misunderstandings, and that can generate resentment. These results are sometimes worse for the relationship than just having the so-called “argument” would be. The key is to learn how to navigate conflicts or differences of opinion in a way that deepens mutual understanding, even if two people still disagree. Imagine that… after a meaningful conversation, two people could actually have increased mutual understanding,<br />
greater mutual respect, and better connection, but still completely disagree. This is very different from avoiding a conversation and not learning more about the other party.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So if we decide to be brave and stay in the conversation, how do we push through the<br />
vulnerability and stay civil?<br />
One of the key pieces of advice I give my executive and graduate students is to explicitly address the underlying intentions. What is the conversation about, and what is it really about? This sounds simple, but tends to be easier said than done. The intention is the deepest-level reason why the topic is so important to the person. We have to understand what truly matters to us, and learn why this topic is so important to the other person as well. For example, two family members may bitterly disagree about the planning of a family event. One or both of them may have an underlying intention of wanting to create more opportunities for the family to stay connected, which may sound very different than the<br />
details of the disagreement. Speaking our intention does not mean that we will suddenly have the same preferences or opinions, but it often helps us navigate difficult conversations and maintain or build connection by actually understanding each other’s motives and interests more closely.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my worst defenses when I get anxious or fearful in conflict is to “put people on the<br />
stand.” I break into vicious lawyer mode and depose people rather than listening. “Last week<br />
you said this. Now you’re saying this. Are you lying now or were you lying then?” It’s terrible<br />
and always ends badly but it’s how I get to “being right.” What’s the solution?<br />
That’s a common strategy for people. But if you want to transform a disagreement into an opportunity<br />
for connection, you need to distinguish between past, present, and future. When disagreements<br />
revolve around what happened in the past, it’s easy to fall into countless volleys of “you said…I<br />
said” back and forth. Focusing on what did or didn’t happen in the past, or what past events led to the<br />
current situation, usually increases tension and decreases connection. A critical first step is to shift<br />
the focus to “Where are we now?” and the most important turning point comes when we focus on the<br />
future. What are we trying to accomplish for the future? What do we want our relationship to be going<br />
forward, and what do we need to do, even if we still disagree, to create that future? What do we want<br />
for our family in the future…or for our team, or our faith community, or our industry? This shift in<br />
focus does not necessarily mean we agree, but it may help us identify agreement about a shared future<br />
that we want to create together.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the most essential steps in this transformative communication, and perhaps the most<br />
courageous, is not only to be open-minded, but to listen with desire to learn more about the other<br />
person’s perspective. I believe, and tell my students, one of the most courageous things to say in an<br />
uncomfortable conversation is “Tell me more.” Exactly when we want to turn away and change the<br />
topic, or just end the conversation, or counter, as you say, we also have the opportunity to ask what<br />
else we need to know to fully understand the other person’s perspective. Help me understand why<br />
this is so important to you, or help me understand why you don’t agree with a particular idea. And<br />
then we have to listen. Really listen. Listen to understand, not about agreeing or disagreeing. We have<br />
to listen to understand in the same way we want to be understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m doing the best I can.<br />
I will allow myself to be seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t assume that people know better and they’re just being malicious or mean-spirited. In highly charged discussions, we can feel shame about not having an informed opinion and these feelings of “not enough” can lead us to bullshitting our way through a conversation. We can also believe we’re responding from real data and have no idea that there’s nothing to back up what we’re saying. Additionally, we can get so caught up in our own pain and fear that truth and fact play second fiddle to emotional pleas for understanding or agreement. Generosity, empathy, and curiosity (e.g., Where did you read this or hear this?) can go a long way in our efforts to question what we’re hearing and introduce fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This experience is also when our team started to understand how important it is for us to build a<br />
culture that supports true belonging. If leaders really want people to show up, speak out, take chances,<br />
and innovate, we have to create cultures where people feel safe—where their belonging is not<br />
threatened by speaking out and they are supported when they make the decision to brave the<br />
wilderness, stand alone, and speak truth to bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s no question that it’s easier to manage a “fitting-in” culture. You set standards<br />
and rules. You lead by “put up or shut up.” But you miss real opportunities—<br />
especially helping your team members find their purpose. When you push a “fitting-in<br />
culture” you miss the opportunity to help people find their personal drive—what’s<br />
coming from their hearts. Leading for true belonging is about creating a culture that<br />
celebrates uniqueness. What serves leaders best is understanding your players’ best<br />
efforts. My job as a leader is to identify their unique gift or contribution. A strong<br />
leader pulls players toward a deep belief in themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chödrön starts:<br />
This lousy world, these lousy people, this lousy government, this lousy everything…<br />
lousy weather…lousy blah, blah, blah. We’re pissed off. It’s too hot in here. It’s too<br />
cold. I don’t like the smell. The person in front is too tall and the person next to me is<br />
too fat. That person is wearing perfume and I’m allergic to it…and just…ugh!<br />
It’s like being barefooted and walking across blazing-hot sand or across cut<br />
glass, or in a field with thorns. Your feet are bare and you say, “This is just too hard.<br />
It’s really hurting, it’s terrible, it’s too sharp, it’s too painful…it’s too hot.” But you<br />
have a great idea! You’re just going to cover everywhere you go with leather. And<br />
then it won’t hurt your feet anymore.<br />
\<br />
Spreading leather everywhere you go so you can cover the pain is like saying,<br />
“I’m going to get rid of her and get rid of him. I’m going to get the temperature right,<br />
and I’m going to ban perfume in the world, and then there will be nothing that bothers<br />
me anywhere. I am going to get rid of everything, including mosquitoes, that bothers<br />
me, anywhere in the world, and then I will be a very happy, content person.”<br />
[She pauses.]<br />
\<br />
We’re laughing, but it’s what we all do. That is how we approach things. We<br />
think, if we could just get rid of everything or cover it with leather, our pain would<br />
go away. Well, sure, because then it wouldn’t be cutting our feet anymore. It’s just<br />
logical, isn’t it? But it doesn’t make any sense, really. Shantideva said, “But if you<br />
simply wrap the leather around your feet.” In other words, if you put on shoes then<br />
you could walk across the boiling sand and the cut glass and the thorns, and it<br />
wouldn’t bother you. So the analogy is, if you work with your mind, instead of trying<br />
to change everything on the outside, that’s how your temper will cool down.<br />
\<br />
So if we love the idea of humankind but people in general are constantly on our nerves, and we<br />
can’t cover everything we don’t like in leather, how do we cultivate and grow our belief in<br />
inextricable human connection internally? The answer that emerged from my research shocked me.<br />
Show up for collective moments of joy and pain so we can actually bear witness to inextricable<br />
human connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the more we’re willing to seek out moments of collective joy and show up for experiences<br />
of collective pain—for real, in person, not online—the more difficult it becomes to deny our human<br />
connection, even with people we may disagree with. Not only do moments of collective emotion<br />
remind us of what is possible between people, but they also remind us of what is true about the human<br />
spirit.</p>

  <p>We are wired for connection. But the key is that, in any given moment of it, it has to be real.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An experience of collective pain does not deliver us from grief or sadness; it is a ministry of<br />
presence. These moments remind us that we are not alone in our darkness and that our broken heart is<br />
connected to every heart that has known pain since the beginning of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would argue that the people we’re sitting next to on those snark couches are often not people with<br />
whom we feel inextricably connected or with whom we feel a deep sense of community. We’ve<br />
simply started hanging out with people who hate the same people we do. That’s not connection. That’s<br />
“you’re either with us or against us.” That’s common enemy intimacy. I don’t really know you, nor<br />
am I invested in our relationship, but I do like that we hate the same people and have contempt for<br />
the same ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Collective assembly meets the primal human yearnings for shared social experiences. We need<br />
to be mindful, however, of how and when those yearnings are being exploited and manipulated for<br />
purposes other than authentic connection. One collective assembly can start to heal the wounds of a<br />
traumatized community, while another can initiate trauma in that same community. When we come<br />
together to share authentic joy, hope, and pain, we melt the pervasive cynicism that often cloaks our<br />
better human nature. When we come together under the false flag of common enemy intimacy, we<br />
amplify cynicism and diminish our collective worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pinker writes: “In fact, neglecting to keep in close contact with people who are important to<br />
you is at least as dangerous to your health as a pack-a-day cigarette habit, hypertension, or obesity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The good news is that this contact doesn’t have to be a long, close interaction, though that’s nice. Making eye contact, shaking someone’s hand, or giving someone a high-five lowers your cortisone level and releases dopamine, making you less stressed and providing a little chemical boost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The foundation of courage is vulnerability—the ability to navigate uncertainty, risk, and<br />
emotional exposure. It takes courage to open ourselves up to joy. In fact, as I’ve written in other<br />
books, I believe joy is probably the most vulnerable emotion we experience. We’re afraid that if we<br />
allow ourselves to feel it, we’ll get blindsided by disaster or disappointment. That’s why in moments<br />
of real joy, many of us dress-rehearse tragedy. We see our child leave for the prom, and all we can<br />
think is “car crash.” We get excited about an upcoming vacation, and we start thinking “hurricane.”<br />
We try to beat vulnerability to the punch by imagining the worst or by feeling nothing in hopes that the<br />
“other shoe won’t drop.” I call it foreboding joy.</p>

  <p>The only way to combat foreboding joy is gratitude. Across the years, the men and women who<br />
could most fully lean in to joy were those who practiced gratitude. In those vulnerable moments of<br />
individual or collective joy, we need to practice gratitude.</p>

  <p>Pain is also a vulnerable emotion. It takes real courage to allow ourselves to feel pain. When<br />
we’re suffering, many of us are better at causing pain than feeling it. We spread hurt rather than let it<br />
inside.</p>

  <p>So, to seek out moments of collective joy and to show up for moments of collective pain, we<br />
have to be brave. That means we have to be vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, joy, trust, intimacy, courage—everything that brings meaning to<br />
our life.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the barrier is our belief about vulnerability, the question becomes: Are we willing to show up and be seen when we can’t control the outcome?</p>

  <p>When the barrier to vulnerability is about safety, the question becomes: Are we willing<br />
to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can’t give people what we don’t have. We can’t fight for what’s not in our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop walking through the world looking for confirmation that you don’t belong. You<br />

made that your goal. True belonging and self-worth are not goods; we don’t negotiate<br />
their value with the world. The truth about who we are lives in our hearts. Our call to<br />
courage is to protect our wild heart against constant evaluation, especially our own.<br />
No one belongs here more than you.</p>
