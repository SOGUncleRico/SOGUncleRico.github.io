> five universal stages of abandonment
**Page 18**


> Abandonment stirs up feelings of not being worthy, not be- longing, not being in control of our lives. Abandonment’s wound lies deep and invisible, making it hard to let go. That’s abandonment—always acting beneath the surface, spilling primal fear into moments of disconnection, disappointment, and loss. It generates feelings of insecurity and self-doubt when we attempt to love again.
**Page 18**


> Feeling as if a knife had been thrust through my heart, I struggled to cope with the same torturous pain I’d specialized in helping my clients cope with for over twenty years.
**Page 19**


> Love yourself.
> Find happiness from within.
> You don’t need a man (or woman) to make you happy. Celebrate your pain.
> Let go and move forward.
**Page 19**


> I have never met people more motivated to move forward and let go than those surviving abandonment
**Page 19**


> But they need more than placebo advice. Faced with the real burden of recovery from so damaging a wound, people need realistic steps that are well researched, clinically tested, and really work
**Page 19**


> Being left by someone you love creates such intense anxiety and despair that many people turn to sedatives like alcohol, pills, or illicit drugs.1 Some commit or try to commit suicide.2
**Page 19**


> When someone you love leaves you, getting through the pain is a matter of survival. Your primary task during the initial crisis is emotional rescue
**Page 21**


> You are struggling to survive at a time when your life feels over, when everything you care about is suddenly gone
**Page 21**


> During my own abandonment crisis, I found it difficult to stay in the moment for more than a few seconds at a time. My mind kept pulling me back into my despair, panic, grief, and hurt
**Page 21**


> The pain stood on either side of the moment. When I’d think about the past—how just yesterday he’d been in my life—I’d feel overwhelming grief. When I thought about my future—the prospect of being alone—I faced the terrifying abyss of the unknown.
**Page 21**


> The moment has no future and no past.
**Page 22**


> The most efficient way to get into the moment is to isolate one of the sensory organs and use it in a deliberate, systematic way to tune in to what’s going on within and around you. For many of my clients, workshop attendees, as well as myself, our sense of hearing helps us most quickly gain entry into the moment.
**Page 22**


> So as I made my way toward the harbor, whenever the pain hit, I stopped walking and shut my eyes to tune out everything but the background noises. I’d concentrate with all my might until my ears could detect the faint buzzing of insects in the grass and the rustling of leaves in the bushes. Listening intently to these sounds brought me momentarily above the depths of despair. Then, to intensify this present-tense oasis, I’d gradually reopen my eyes to attend to a few carefully selected sights, such as the lace pattern of sunlight sprinkling through the tree branches. Using the moment’s respite, I remained in tune with the sensations of the here and now as long as I could, which would usually last all of about four seconds. Then I’d dissolve into fear and despair once again.

This book provides a way for you to take action—not only with the lessons but with the other healing balms presented throughout. Participate in your own recovery. Rather than just reading or imagining what the exercises are like, you will gain most by doing them.7
**Page 24**


> Observing its shape and dimensions from a distance, I was able to see for the first time that abandonment has its own kind of grief—a powerful grief universal to human beings. I could see where its natural folds lay—that it broke down into five universal stages: Shattering, Withdrawal, Internalizing, Rage, and Lifting.
**Page 25**


> The Five Stages of Abandonment

 Shattering: The painful tear in your attachment, a stab wound to the heart. The sudden disconnection sends you into panic, devastation, shock, and bewilderment. You feel symbiotically attached to your lost love—as if you couldn’t survive alone. You’re in crisis and feel as if you’d been severed from your Siamese twin and you were in the recovery room in pain and alone. You try to keep remnants of your fractured self together, but your whole sense of reality feels destroyed. One minute you succumb to the overwhelming despair, suicidal feelings, and sorrow. The next, you see glimmers of hope

Withdrawal: Love withdrawal is just like heroin withdrawal—each involves intense yearning for the object of desire, and this craving is mediated by opioids within your body.8 You feel a painful aching, longing, needing a love fix and can’t get one. You feel strung out. Your mind incessantly waits for your lost love to call or return. You’re plagued with separation anxiety—an expectant, urgent feeling of heightened vulnerability. Physical components of withdrawal from love are the same as they are for withdrawal from heroin. You’re in withdrawal from your endogenous opiates9 as well as suffused with fight-or-flight stress hormones. Your withdrawal symptoms include wasting, weight loss, wakefulness

Internalizing: You begin to turn your rage over being rejected against yourself, which accounts for the intense depression that accompanies abandonment.10 You idealize your lost love at your own expense, indicting yourself for losing the most important person in your life. You internalize the rejection, interpreting the dismissal as evidence of your alleged personal unworthiness. Internalizing is the most critical stage, when your wound can become infected, scarring your self-image.11 You inculcate a narcissistic injury.12 Your self-doubt has the power to implant an invisible drain deep within the self that insidiously leaches self-esteem from within. You have grave doubts about your ability to hold someone’s love and blame yourself for the loss. Old feelings of insecurity merge into your new wound, creating lingering insecurity. Without recovery, this feeling can interfere in future relationships.

Rage: You attempt to reverse the rejection, expressing rage over being left. You are restless to get your life back in order and riddled with low frustration tolerance, your anger spurting out of control.13 You resent being thrust into aloneness against your will.14 You regress into fantasies of revenge and retaliation. Your aggressive energy is like a pressure cooker. You boil over easily, sometimes spewing anger onto innocent bystanders (like your friends when they fail to understand what you’re going through). Many of you who have difficulty with assertiveness tend to invert your rage into an agitated depression

Lifting: Life begins to distract you, lifting you back into it. You experience intervals of peace and confidence. Abandonment’s lessons are learned, and you get ready to love again. Without recovery, some of you make the mistake of lifting above your feelings, losing touch with your emotional center, becoming more isolated than before.

> The S.W.I.R.L. Process provides a framework by which to organize your overwhelming experience
**Page 26**


> Bear in mind that the stages are not discrete time packets but rather one continuous process
**Page 26**


> Mini-Swirls
**Page 29**


> Most therapists understand that the underlying abandonment wound can be easily accessed in their client’s most mundane events of everyday life. For survivors of childhood abandonment, as well as those who are going through a heartbreak, the abandonment nerve twinges if, in the course of a normal day, they feel criticized, excluded, misunderstood, overlooked, taken for granted, belittled, disrespected, or made to wait.
**Page 29**


> With our vulnerability heightened, almost anything can cause us to begin swirling. It can be very subtle. Feeling left out, ignored by a friend, or failing to get recognition at work can set swirl in motion. On a bad day, losing your keys can send you swirling. Most of us realize we’re overreacting, but we tend to fault ourselves rather than recognizing the universal process beneath our taut nerves and tender feelings.
**Page 29**


> Akeru is the name I’ve given to a program that turns the pain of an ending into the beginning of positive change. Akeru is a Japanese word with many meanings: to end, to begin, to pierce, to start, to expire, to unwrap, to turn over, to close, and to open. It’s a perfect word to describe the cycle of renewal and healing involved in abandonment recovery. Akeru also refers to the empty space created when someone leaves, allowing you to see a painful loss as an opportunity to fill a void with something new and positive.
**Page 30**


> Throughout the book, I guide you through each of the five Akeru exercises. There is one for each stage of the S.W.I.R.L. Process.
For Shattering, the Akeru exercise is called Staying in the Moment.
For Withdrawal, the exercise involves creating a Big You / Little You Dialogue.
> For Internalizing, there is a visualization exercise called Building a Dream House. For Rage, you discover a powerful self-awareness tool called Outer Child.
> For Lifting, the exercise involves Increasing Your Capacity for Love and connection
**Page 31**


> Hopelessness is a powerful feeling belonging to the Shattering stage, but it is a feeling, not a fact. It passes, giving way to a brighter outlook. When you’re in its grips, though, your sense of dead and panic feel real, warping your sense of reality with visions of always and never.
> “I’ll always feel broken and alone. I’ll never love again.”
**Page 32**


> Shattering is the first stage of abandonment—when your love is torn and your security’s ripped away. You are suddenly in disconnect mode. Your heart pounds and stomach turns upside down. Sever- ing a relationship creates real trauma.1 It sends you into shock, disbelief, bewilderment. You feel unable to face the reality of your life. You’re alienated from your feelings, literally disconnected from self. Noth- ing seems real except the pain.
**Page 32**


> Shattering fractures the lens of reality. We experience visions of our lost love in every blue car that drives by or think we hear her voice coming from somewhere in the crowd.2 We overreact to every love song on the radio and agonize over every lost caress.3
**Page 32**


> Shattering also occurs in ripples. The emotional volcano of a breakup produces aftershocks
**Page 32**


> The everyday trials and tribulations of life trigger emotional memories of earlier losses, flooding our current crisis with old familiar feelings of helplessness and insecurity.
**Page 33**


> They experience patterns of abandonment, set in motion by the aftershocks of a previous loss. Bits and particles of a shattered self, from previous losses, continually work their way up from the wound to the surface. They block the healthy flow of your relationships and your life.
**Page 33**


> and suddenly feel desperate for that special connection you no lon- ger have.
**Page 33**


> Even as you feel yourself falling into an abyss, faith in your capacity for healing helps you grow wings on the way down.7 Eventually you lift to greater life and love than before.
**Page 34**


> It was unbearable agony—like being burned alive very slowly over a barbecue pit
**Page 34**


> One of the things that therapists know too well is that most people do not acknowledge the depths of their pain. They don’t give themselves the opportunity to validate the strength it takes to go on. So many of us are in survival mode
**Page 34**


> People frequently ask: “Why can’t I control the pain or at least make it calm down?”
> I explain: If you’ve lost your significant other, you’ve sustained a real wound—a wound that must be taken care of. Like it is with any other serious injury, you can’t just switch off the pain. Strangely, most of us think we should be able to.
**Page 35**


> When we find that we can’t regulate the intensity, we feel ashamed for succumbing to the emotional excess.
**Page 35**


> Imprinted in your amygdala are memories of how you responded to fearful events accumulated since childhood—events that conditioned you to respond automatically to future events. Its emotional memory is believed to contain traces of your birth experience as well.9 The amygdala reacts to abandon- ment as a threat. We experience this reaction as fear.10 Our first fear is abandonment—being left with no one to ensure our survival. Witness the infant who cries in terror when his mother’s face disappears from his bedside.
**Page 35**


> When the threat is loss of a relationship, your body reacts the same way, but you interpret the surge of neurohormones and other physiological signs of self-defense as “going to pieces.”
**Page 35**


>
**Page 35**


> The amygdala is like an overprotective watchdog during abandonment. It perceives losing your emotional attachment as a direct threat to your life and acts swiftly to alert your autonomic nervous system to go into red alert. Because heartbreak is an ongoing crisis, your ever-watchful amygdala keeps you in an action-ready state, as if you were sustaining an ongoing siege of violence.
**Page 36**


> You automat- ically go into survival mode, which, quoting from the annals of medical humor, include the Four Fs of Survival: fighting, fleeing, freezing, and sexual reproduction.
**Page 36**


> Abandonment constitutes a sustained emotional crisis.12 It’s not like a train crash that happens once and then you set out to recover. The stress of abandonment is sustained day after day as the ramifications of your loss mount. Each new jolt of the reality that your relationship is threatened sends your amygdala into increasingly high alert. It deploys repeated volleys of stress hor- mones to keep you on edge and battle ready for the long haul.

> you might wake up with separation anxiety each morning or feel shock waves of despair during certain moments in your day for an ongoing period.
**Page 37**


> Shame and Self-blame
> Many people have trouble accepting the intense fear and despair involved in loss. Faulting yourself for feeling miserable only makes the crisis worse because it creates shame—a destructive emotion.18 Shame is a major component of heartbreak, especially if you feel rejected. Losing someone’s love can feel de- moralizing and plunge you into self-doubt, causing you to feel unworthy, defective even. It is humiliat- ing to feel that you’ve been thrown away by someone you love.
> Shame is an insidious and destructive emotion. Unless you challenge its assumptions, it can go un- derground and become an internal saboteur, bent on using your most vulnerable feelings against you.
> The antidote to shame is self-acceptance.
**Page 38**


> Accepting the Pain of Loss
> Learning to accept the pain of loss helps reduce shame. This is a critical step in healing. Until people learn this acceptance, they remain in protest. Protesting your current circumstances is an unrealistic attempt to ward off having to face your reality.19 Rather than divest your energy in defending yourself against rejection, faulting yourself, beating yourself up, or trying to fight the grief, take a moment to ac- cept the simple fact that your turmoil is about loss. What you are feeling is the pain of losing someone’s love. Indeed this is painful, and you have every right to feel devastating loss. Accepting the universal basis of this pain helps you inch toward accepting the reality of the loss and progress through the inev- itable process of grief.
**Page 39**


> When I mention the word “acceptance,” some abandonment survivors, impatient for relief ask: “Acceptance. Is that all there is to do? Just grin and bear it?”
> I answer: Acceptance is only a first step. It centers you in reality. It reduces shame, because you realize that your pain is legitimate. It helps end the protest and restore calm. It prepares you to use the emotional turbulence of abandonment to gain inner strength. This is why we’ll continue to work on acceptance throughout our journey.

> One of the functions of our higher brain—the cerebral cortex—is to talk sense to our emotional brain. In this manner, human beings have calmed themselves down over the centuries.
**Page 39**


> The loss of your relationship that has your life in a swirl isn’t the end of the world after all, but the loss of an attachment to one person.
**Page 40**


> Providing precise cognitive information is one of the ways your cerebral cortex distinguishes you from the rest of the animal kingdom

> My life will never be the same.
> I will die lonely.
> I will never love again.
> The pain will get worse and I won’t be able to withstand it. What if I die of heartbreak?
> Stating your fears helps you face them.
**Page 41**


> As you make your way to that peaceful place inside, you might come across uncomfortable feelings— fear, doubt, or sorrow. Rather than fight the pain, imagine that you are cutting a path right through it, all the way to the very center of the turmoil to a sacred, protected place inside. In this center, there is no past or present, no fear or sorrow—only your awareness of being alive now.
**Page 45**


> But when Sarah left me, I felt so broken up inside that my sense of self was scattered to the four winds. What used to come naturally now took all my effort. I was too anxious to locate any inner peace at first. But I knew it was there somewhere and that I just had to find a way to create it again. I discovered that counting my breaths helped me center in. And there it was, an oasis inside—an oasis I could return to when my nerves got on edge, no matter how much effort it took.”
**Page 46**


> Through thirty years of clinical practice treating people suffering from heartbreak and then going through it myself, I’ve found that traditional methods aren’t able to get at the source of the intense anxiety and despair of this type of wound. Reciting affirmations in the mirror or just going to therapy isn’t enough to reach the underlying insecurity and sadness of abandonment. The fear is too primal, the self-doubt too deep. The only human resources strong enough to heal the powerful feelings of aban- donment are your awareness and your imagination. Awareness is what helped you find your center, and imagination helped you create peacefulness and hope within it.

> The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.”
**Page 52**


> Shattering means you’ve hit an emotional bottom. This bottom can help you transform your life. It’s up to you to discover the larger purpose of your current turmoil.
**Page 54**


> In the midst of the despair and hopelessness of Shattering, we believe that losing our loved one means losing the possibility for love and connection forever. It is this fear, above all, that makes ending a relationship so anguishing. Therapists know only too well how hard it is to convince people that their lives are not over.
**Page 56**


> Almost anything is bearable if we know it is temporary.

> Not everyone needs to find a relationship to be happy, but all of us need to know we could succeed at one if we wanted it.

> When your defenses are shattered, you are most receptive to reconstructing new patterns.
**Page 57**


> We belong to a culture immersed in the romantic notion that attraction is destiny.3 We go around looking for someone who stirs up the right chemistry.4 Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is possible to develop chemistry toward a person you may not have felt initially attracted to.
**Page 58**


> There are biological mechanisms in place to see that this happens.5 Sleeping in proximity to someone promotes bonding, as does skin-to-skin contact, kissing, caressing, hugging, intimate sex, and orgasm. So do promises of fidelity, financial interdependency, and steadfast companionship. Caring together for children or pets, working in partnership toward mutual goals, and marking your milestones as a couple with rituals and celebrations—all of these deepen attachment and kindle the love bond between two people.
**Page 59**


> But a common bind for millions of lonely people is that they are attracted only to emotionally unavailable partners. Their radar homes in on those who are destined to leave them in the end. They’re drawn like moths to abandonment’s flame.
**Page 59**


> Abandoholism is similar to the other -holisms, but instead of being addicted to a substance, you’re addicted to the emotional drama of heartbreak. So you pursue unavailable partners to keep the roman- tic intensity going and to keep your body’s love chemicals flowing.8

> abandonment. Feeling attracted to someone creates a fear of losing that person. Fear of being abandoned can become so intrusive that it disrupts your ability to maintain your emotional balance while pursuing a new relationship. Try as you might to hide your insecurity, it drains your confidence.
**Page 60**


> Abandoholics tend to swing back and forth between these emotional poles. Your pendulum swings between fear of abandonment and fear of engulfment. You’re either pursuing hard-to-get lovers, driven by a desperate urge to bond with them, or you’re feeling turned off because someone is genuinely inter- ested in you. You’re always at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum, never on mutual ground, never secure, never at peace.
**Page 61**


> Some people are so afraid of rejection that they avoid relationships altogether. This is called aban- dophobism.
**Page 61**


> Abandophobics act out their fear of abandonment by remaining socially isolated or by ap- pearing to search for someone, when in fact they are pursuing people who are unattainable, all to avoid the risk of getting attached to a real prospect—someone who might abandon them sooner or later.
**Page 61**


> Many of you describe getting hooked on someone who dangles the possibility of a relationship in front of you but never emotionally follows through. What better way to avoid a real relationship than to pursue an eternally unavailable partner?
**Page 61**


> The insecurity, yearning, and neediness you felt toward your parents caused you to doubt your self-worth and put them on pedestals. Over time, you internalized this need for approval and you idealized others at your own expense. It became a pattern.
**Page 62**


> Feeling emotionally deprived and “less-than” is what you’ve come to expect. It’s the only scenario you can feel. You’ve come to associate these needy, lovesick, insecure feelings with being in love.
**Page 62**


> Some of you had loving, caring parents but felt insecure in your relationships with peers. You felt attracted to heartthrobs in high school but didn’t feel strong enough about yourself to negotiate mutual relation- ships with them. Adolescent relationships are notoriously fickle14 to begin with; their emotional dynam- ics are painfully unstable and scarring. Many of you internalized self-doubt during this volatile time and inculcated fears that continue to haunt the future.
**Page 62**


> When you seek acceptance from a withholding partner, you place yourself in a one- down position, re-creating the unequal dynamics you had with your parents or peers. You choreograph this scenario over and over, playing out a fantasy in which you try to win love and acceptance from a hard-to-get lover and remain enslaved by your own need for approval.
**Page 63**


> Conversely, you are unable to feel anything when someone freely admires or appreciates you as much as you do them.

> it is likely that you internalized the intense longing, craving feelings of Withdrawal. You learned to feel a chronic waiting for life, a kind of emotional emptiness—feelings that persist into adult life. Being stuck in Withdrawal can lead to dependency and co-dependency patterns in your adult relationships, in which you’re too needy or too enmeshed in other peo- ple’s needs. The emotional hunger gets you to self-medicate with shopping, alcohol, people, television, gambling, and other compulsive behaviors.
**Page 82**


> Once you pare your overwhelming emotions down into a simple word and attach its bite-size cause, you can swallow this reality whole. This process lifts you from the emotional soup as well as rescues you from those tediously painful details you are mired in. It encourages you to get the big picture and empowers you to focus your energy on confronting the reality you are facing.

**Page 94**


> The powerful impetus to bond is ever present, but we are most aware of its pull when our relation- ship is ripped away.
**Page 94**


> During Shattering, we feel shock, desperation, and panic because we’ve been cut off from everything we depended on for comfort, security, and love. The painful tear in our attachment ex- poses raw nerves. It is a source of intense discomfort, but we can redirect its energy to fuel our recovery

> Feelings are now. They can best be worked through in the moment.
**Page 94**


> You may have noticed that when your mind is wracked with pain from a Shattering, radio and tele- vision don’t usually provide enough stimulation to draw you out of your worries. It’s too easy to listen to music or watch television and still be into your painful thoughts. At these moments, it helps to use your sense of hearing in a less passive, more focused manner. It’s time to turn off the radio and tune in to the background noises so that you can use this exercise to its full benefit.
**Page 95**


> Focus on the subtle textures of sound in the background until you can detect their origins. As you’re doing so, you momentarily leave your painful thoughts. The more engaged in focused listening, the less your panic and grief can take over. When your painful thoughts return, just focus your attention once again on a sensory experience, such as tuning in to the faintest sound you can hear, and hold on to it as long as you can.
**Page 95**


> Your ability to get into the moment serves as a foundation for the rest of your journey of recovery.
**Page 98**


> The Withdrawal stage is when you come to terms with being alone—physically alone, emotionally alone, or both.
**Page 102**


> During Withdrawal, your body and mind ache for your lost relationship. You don’t feel its pull until the shock of Shattering wears off and a sense of wrenching deprivation sets in. Day after day, as more and more of your needs go unfulfilled, you yearn for the security you once took for granted. You’re in Withdrawal, addicted to love no longer available to you. There’s nobody to ease the pain but you.
**Page 102**


> Your task is to learn how to redirect the energy of Withdrawal to make aloneness work for you.

> Being alone is not the problem. Alone is not loneliness. Alone is a lifestyle many people choose. It is only when feelings of abandonment are present that being alone can create the following situations

> You want love and connection. It’s missing. You want your future secured. It’s gone up in smoke. You want companionship, someone to care about you. You’ve been left. You want to regain control of your life. You feel powerless.
**Page 106**


> The Withdrawal stage isn’t logical. It doesn’t matter whether the person you’re grieving has shown herself to be an abandoner, a cad, or a ne’er-do-well. You’re going through the powerful grief of abandonment. It’s a psychobiological process. It doesn’t operate according to your friends’ or even your own schedule; it has a timetable of its own.
**Page 110**


> Abandonment is an example of “ambiguous loss”10 in that it usually involves grieving someone who is still alive. You don’t have a body to mourn over. This means that closure remains ambiguous and unresolved. Your wound remains open for a longer period, prolonging your recovery time.11
**Page 110**


> They are missing the love of someone who is still present.
**Page 110**


> Another commonly expressed grief is when you’re alone not because you’ve lost a relationship, but because you haven’t found one yet. You are grieving over not having anyone in your life and you feel bereft of that special connection to someone—someone you’re still hoping to meet. Many suspect that unresolved abandonment is behind their struggle to find an eligible candidate to fulfill their dreams, but aren’t sure how to remove their stumbling blocks.
**Page 110**


> Even those of you who grew up in idyllically secure families may have developed these tendencies because of your neurobiological makeup, which might even include the size of your locus ceruleus,15 a structure located deep within your brain. Whether the cause was biological or the family, the result is the same—you feel vulnerable and insecure.

> Accept the reality that you are alone as we are all alone. The sensations of life are for you to experience alone, all for yourself. You are whole all by yourself. When we are able to appreciate our separate- ness, we become available to the love of others.”
**Page 114**


> The idea is to accept that you are alone for now and decide what you can do to make the best of it.
> This requires a huge leap—all the way from focusing your energy on what you wish you had to what you do have. And what is that? You have yourself and your determination to benefit from your abandonment experience.

> To find yourself alone not by choice is the only gateway you’ll ever have to really know- ing yourself. Only when the deep pain is acknowledged can the truly transformative occur. The painful aloneness creating this transformation is conceptually similar to Bill Wilson’s writings of psychic displacement, which when it occurs, miraculously transforms the hard-core addict into a recovering person

> Here is a thought experiment: A thought experiment is different from a statement of fact. You don’t have to believe it is true. It asks that you suspend your rational judgment to consider a proposition designed to help you gain a new perspective. Consider that your abandonment has placed you exactly where you need to be to work on what you need to work on.

> Your ability to be your own separate person is critical to sustaining a long-term adult relationship.
> At the beginning, you can’t stand to be apart from your partner. As you enter the courtship period, you do a lot of testing, even when you’re not aware of it. You play adult forms of peek-a-boo to deter- mine your partner’s staying power. As you both prove your ability to commit, a sense of security sets in

> You go about your independent lives feeling you have

**Page 120**


> The more secure you feel in your ability to be separate, the fewer demands you put on the relation-
> ship. The more stable the relationship, the less direct contact you need from your partner to reinvoke the emotional connection. As with children, who need to be securely attached in order to be alone, the surer you are of your partner, the more secure you feel when you’re off doing your own thing.
**Page 120**


> . Contrary to what some people believe, feeling secure with your back- ground object facilitates not dependence, but independence
**Page 120**


> You make independent strides precisely because you’re able to use your partner as a background object. Your ability to be alone grows from the security of knowing that he or she is safely tucked away in your hip pocket.
**Page 120**


> Just as you are sustained by the air you breathe without being conscious of each breath, you are sustained by the security you receive from having a background object. Your mate provides an invisible security blanket.
**Page 120**


> Many people search the ends of the earth to regain that sense of security
**Page 120**


> Often it is those who have background objects who remain oblivious to the challenges facing those who don’t.
**Page 121**


> Be assured that this isolation, desolation, and despair are temporary. Living without a background object is a challenge. Your task is to learn how to subsist emotionally without relying on this invisible support. You can do so because you are an adult who can replenish this security through your own resources. You can acquire emotional self-reliance.

> The mammalian brain perceives abandonment as a threat to your existence. The mammal in us is the mouse, elephant, and chimpanzee—the part that thrives on sleeping in proximity to others, touch, cud- dling, pairing off, procreating, the warmth of skin-to-skin contact, the safety of connection.
> It’s the mammal in us that holds attachment.
**Page 132**


> When you are in love withdrawal, your symptoms are as intense as they would be from heroin with- drawal.
**Page 132**


> When you’re in the craving, nagging, and yearning of opioid withdrawal, your mammalian brain goes on a search-and-recovery mission. The surges of stress hormones keep your mind hypervigilant, searching for any sign of her approach. This waiting, searching state is universal to all kinds of grief. John Bowlby, pioneer in separation and attachment, called it “searching for the lost object.”9 Your emo- tional brain automatically scans your inner and outer worlds, seeking a love object it perceives as tanta- mount to your survival.
> “I just couldn’t stop thinking about every last thing Lonny said to me,” says Marie, “going through date books and photographs looking for a clue as to why he stopped loving me. I’d drive by his work all the time, hoping to at least catch a glimpse of his car, just so I’d know where he was.”
> Consciously you know your mate is out of reach, but try telling your mammalian brain to accept this fact! Your amygdala relentlessly keeps seeking the object of your obsession.
**Page 132**


> This explains why you can have an ever-more-powerful response each time you encounter your heartbreaker. Sometimes this response can last for decades.
> “It had been twenty-five years since I’d laid eyes on my great- est heartbreaker, Beth. It caught me by surprise. I walked into a luncheonette, and she was walking out with some guy. You’d think we just broke up. I reacted as if I’d just seen a ghost.”
**Page 133**


> When you’ve had an especially painful breakup, just thinking about your ex or spotting her in the crowd can cause your heart to skip a beat, your stomach to flip flop, and old desires to reawaken. If you see him with a new lover, you can go into apoplexy. But these are all just signs of your mammalian brain trying either to
> entice you back into the procreative bond or to warn you not to make the same mistake again—to avoid grizzly bears and people who cause intense fear or pain.
**Page 133**


> I imagine I see him whizzing by in a car or in the faces of the crowd.
> When a visual image first hits the eye, the information gives but an approximate impression. To get more detailed information, the sensory input must travel through five synapses as it passes from the back of your brain before it gets to your cerebral frontal cortex. This takes additional seconds before you can appraise the situation more accurately.13
> ❏ I am preoccupied with the relationship—I look at old photos, contact people who knew me and my ex together, and incessantly go over the details of the separation.
> The surging stress hormones and depleted opioids cause you to automatically search for the lost object.14
**Page 137**


> I have an impulse to stalk my abandoner. I drive by her house or call his phone incessantly.
> Two reasons: (1) because your mammalian brain is bent on its search-and-recovery mission, gearing you

**Page 137**


> Making a mind-body connection is more than just an intellectual exercise. Gathering scientific infor- mation empowers you to strengthen your cognitive mind, but it doesn’t help all by itself. You have to integrate this information with what is going on inside. It’s important to absorb the fact that idealizing your abandoner is an idea not based on your wisdom but driven by your biological instincts. Believing she is the one and only comes from an ill-informed place, written by the blunt instrument of your mam- malian brain. Remind yourself that obsessing about him is not because he is irreplaceable but because your mammalian brain has you searching for its lost object.

> “I too have longed for someone’s return,” says the swan. “I too have known a wounder. Like you, I thought I could not live without her. I yearned for her to comfort me from the very wound she inflicted. But she could never be the one to comfort me. The wounder never can.”
**Page 139**


> Tell me more about her,” begs the little girl.
> “She, like all abandoners, became powerful just by wounding me so deeply. She brought me to a feeling of insignificance and pain. And all I could do was marvel at her power to accomplish so mighty a task. Pain creates fear, and we give power to those we fear. Reduced to helplessness, I saw my wounder as the more powerful, the more valuable, the more beautiful for having vanquished me. I could only worship my wounder,” admits the swan, turning gracefully toward the little girl. “But the pain this caused helped me find my own will to survive and survive separately.”

**Page 140**


> During Withdrawal, your mammalian brain desperately seeks its attachment. The frustration of seeking and not finding is what Withdrawal energy is all about. When your powerful drive toward attachment is thwarted, it doesn’t just give up. It continues its relentless pull—unless you invest your energy in someone else,17 and that someone is the one person you do have—you. Your drive is nudging you to invest in making a new connection, and that connection is to self.

> My life is exactly where I need it to be to work on what I need to work on.*
**Page 141**


> Accepting the universal need for connection does not mean that you must first find a mate to be happy. It means that you must provide an object of focus for your attachment energy, and that object, first and foremost, is you. Learning to love yourself is critical to recovery.

> Action Bullets are also different from magic bullets in that Action Bullets recognize that any magic existing in the world exists inside you. You may wish there were a magic bullet or someone outside of yourself who could perform some miracle treatment to absolve you of your problems. You may even hope that just reading through this workbook and answering some of the questions will lift you from your self-defeating patterns and change your life. This kind of wishful thinking is highly prevalent.
> People are always holding out for a magic bullet, expecting that one more book, one more tape, one more lecture will finally free them. But the magic is not in any book, exercise, lecture, or guru. The magic bullet is not even inside this workbook, but inside your ability to take action. It is entirely up to you to change your life. Just reading words on a page, no matter how much wisdom they contain, cannot transform your life. You must integrate their wisdom with action. Commit to change.

> Internalizing is the most critical stage of abandonment, when your body and soul incorporate the deep personal wound of losing someone’s love. Without recovery, this wound can leave permanent scarring. It burrows beneath the surface where it continues to generate insecurity and undermine your self-esteem for decades to come.
**Page 162**


> abandonment is a profound enough trauma to implant an invisible drain deep within the self that works insidiously to siphon off self-esteem from within. The paradox for abandonment survivors is that no matter what they do to build their self-esteem, the invisible wound of abandonment is always working to drain it away.1
**Page 162**


> Abandonment is a cumulative wound, containing all of the disconnections, disappointments, and heartbreaks of a lifetime.
**Page 162**


> There are several reasons why people resist debunking the myth, even though it is at their expense.
> First, convincing yourself that your partner is omnipotent and irreplaceable is a way of justifying the intensity of your despair. It allows you to say, “It’s not because I’m weak or lowly that I’m still drown- ing in grief. It is because my beloved was so unbelievably special.” You don’t feel as out of control for succumbing to the emotional excesses of heartbreak if you believe that you’ve lost the whole kingdom
**Page 165**


> Second, putting your beloved on a pedestal is a way of sustaining the emotional connection, al- though now the relationship takes place only in your mind. As painful as the yearning and self-doubts are, remaining obsessed allows you to feel attached to your abandoner, delaying the moment at which you must face the abyss of total disconnection—of having nobody special to think about. Your uncon- scious reasoning is, “It’s better to pine away than to have no one to think about at all.” Being obsessed beats being totally alone.
**Page 165**


> People need direction in reversing abandonment’s deep personal injury. Otherwise they resort to scram- bling for their lost self-esteem points by comparing their looks, pocketbooks, and academic degrees to what others have.
**Page 166**


> Feeling good about yourself ” says the black swan, “has nothing to do with whether you’re talented, or beautiful, or strong, or smart, or any of these things. These have nothing to do with the value of your own existence. They are only attributes—the spokes of the wheel—not its center.”
**Page 167**


> Self- esteem is something you give to yourself. That’s why it’s called self-esteem. Self-image is based on how you imagine others perceive you. It’s based on your perception of their perception, all of which is subject to distortion.
**Page 167**


> If you’ve been left, you’ve been externally invalidated. You feel demoralized because the most im- portant person in your life presumably no longer loves, wants, or needs you. So you look to the external world to take away the awful feelings of unworthiness
**Page 167**


> Being self-conscious means you’re preoccupied with “how you’re doing” or “how you’re coming across to others.” This self-evaluation can become obsessive and causes some to feel inhibited in the company of others, and others to put on a show. Either way, self-consciousness interferes with your ability to authentically be yourself.

**Page 178**


> In other words, when someone you’re attracted to doesn’t return the compliment, it causes you to feel sexually powerless and romantically invisible—as if you had a limited capacity to establish mutual at- traction.

> It is not only onto the self that we attribute blame for the slings and arrows of everyday life. We fre- quently blame our feelings on other people, places, and things.
**Page 179**


> Why Do We Falsely Attribute?
> One of the reasons we appropriate blame to the wrong cause is that most of us don’t know what to do with our uncomfortable feelings. We either internalize them (blame them on ourselves) or externalize them (project them onto someone or something else).
**Page 180**


> Feelings are neither good nor bad. Having uncomfortable feelings does not reflect on your wor- thiness as a person. It is how you handle your feelings that should determine whether to give yourself esteem or not. Feelings are given; they just are. Having the feelings in the first place? Over that, you have no control. What to do about them? Over that, you are master.

> Going through abandonment mimics the anxiety and despair of major depression

> “It hurts,” whimpers the little girl.
> “Yes,” says the swan. “Pain is when the future and the past overlap and squeeze out the pres- ent. You must carve out a path between them. You must find the moment. Get into its groove, Amanda. Use all of your will to cross over into your present life and accept its realities. Once you do, you will be filled with the power of existence, free to act, to move forward. Fill yourself with the reality of your life, even the reality of your momentary aloneness, and experience the sensations of life all around you in this moment.”

> Self-esteem isn’t about achieving a goal once and letting it end there. You need to keep moving toward your highest potential. This effort sustains your ability to value and respect yourself.
**Page 183**


> If achievement marks the end of a goal, then you need to con- stantly create new goals. Life can feel flat and self-esteem can droop unless you find a new mountain to climb.15
**Page 184**


> It isn’t achievement that rewards us; it’s the process of getting there that keeps good feelings flowing toward self. When you’re actively working on things, you earn the right to give yourself credit, not for the end product of your efforts but for the efforts themselves.
**Page 184**


> When our partners dangle love in front of us but don’t follow through, we tend to give over our con- trol. All of the energy keeping the relationship together comes from us—we feel the love and attachment for both parties. At this point, the craving and desperation we feel begin to seem more like an addiction than a relationship.
**Page 189**


> For most abandonment survivors, just being close to someone can throw us into an overblown emo- tional response. Love makes us vulnerable. When someone gets close, she bumps into our love wounds and hits against the tenderness and pain left over from past abandonments.
**Page 191**


> They haven’t figured out yet that they can only experience that intense craving for unavailable partners

> The hitch is that the love she felt at the beginning was intense and compelling because she was pursuing love, not attaining it.
**Page 195**


> What you fail to realize is that the love pangs were really conquest, competitive pursuit, and insecurity all mixed together. You loved before, but only when your partners were withholding something you wanted, and this withholding generated a release of love chemicals to keep you in heated pursuit.

> Belonging to someone is a welcome relief from the chronic malaise associated with heartache, loneliness, and feeling not so good about yourself.
**Page 199**


> Stuck in a Romantic ldeal
> A great deal of your love response involves conditioning.13 Your parents and other early experiences con- ditioned you to respond to certain stimuli. Maybe you tried to win over a mother who was emotionally unreliable. Later you associated the insecurity and emotional hunger you felt with romantic love. In high school you didn’t feel any chemistry unless your date evoked these old yearning feelings.
> During adolescence and early adulthood, these romantic notions get played out and reinforced by crushes and heartaches. Some of you have a hard time letting go of your high-school values, even when they prove to be at odds with your adult needs.
**Page 201**


> The need for immediate gratification is common among abandonment survivors of childhood. To assuage uncomfortable feelings stemming from your accumulation of losses and disconnections, you grab for quick fixes, even when you know that doing so sabotages your ambitions. Getting stuck in this pattern causes your dreams to drift farther and farther away. You grow anxious and guilty about not reaching your potential
**Page 203**


> The antidote to succumbing to self-defeating behaviors is to build your self-esteem by engaging in constructive activities. Once you raise your sense of worth a notch or two, your ability to delay gratifi- cation increases and you inch closer to reaching your human potential.
**Page 203**


> Emotional hunger from past wounds urges you to seek insubstantial rewards; the equivalent of candy, which pleasures your mouth but leaves you malnourished and stimulates greater hunger later on. Laden with self-doubt and depleted of con- fidence, you don’t feel strong enough about yourself to sustain the ongoing effort it takes to achieve higher-reaching goals. This explains why abandonment survivors are notorious underachievers
**Page 203**


> Abandonment survivors tend to procrastinate because they’ve internalized negative messages of re- jection. Their sense of entitlement has been breached. So they forgo the opportunity to feel good about themselves and their achievements.
**Page 205**


> Giving in to your impulses at the expense of achieving your goals brings on overwhelming feelings of fear, shame, embarrassment, and guilt. Depreciating yourself in this manner intensifies your desire to medicate the anxiety with more immediate gratifications, higher doses of alcohol, food, or shopping. This need for quick fixes creates a downward spiral leading to self-contempt.

> We discussed some of them in chapter 5—the powerful drugs within your body that promote attachment to your partner and to your social group—oxytocin, phenylethylamine (PEA), opioids, dopamine, prolactin, etc.,16 as well as becoming addicted to each other’s pheromones.17
**Page 210**


> Letting go is the first step in bringing closure to your lost relationship. It allows you to relinquish your tenacious emotional grip on your loved one and accept the reality of loss. Only then can you grieve and move on. In letting go, you surrender to the positive forces of change. Re- ality is in flux, forever changing. Appreciate the transience of life by facing your reality in the moment.

**Page 212**


> Acceptance doesn’t mean grin and bear it—although in the early stages of abandonment, it may feel that way. Acceptance involves facing facts and letting go. Borrowing another piece of twelve-step philosophy, it means “accepting life on life’s terms.”2
**Page 212**


> An unrealistic expectation is a premeditated resentment.
**Page 212**


> Let go of unrealistic expectations of others. This means letting others be who they are without the need to control.
> This is a big step. It means giving up the need to have other people fill your hungry hole. Relinquish- ing people from your needs and demands sets up the dynamics for healthy relationships. It allows you to love people unconditionally for who they are, rather than who you need them to be.
**Page 212**


> Let go to focus not on your partner but on how you handle your side of the equation. Tell her your feelings, treat her according to your needs, but let go of your need to control her response. Over that, you have no control. Letting go allows you to interact with her as a separate person and stand on your own two feet.
**Page 213**


> Let go of your need to control the future. Do what you can each day to maximize your life oppor- tunities and then let go of what you can’t control—the outcome. When you arrive at the future, you will face it one day at a time.
**Page 213**


> Yearning for some- one who has discarded you creates a deep personal injury.
**Page 215**


> Losing someone’s love—being left behind—makes going through divorce, separation, and isolation extremely difficult.
**Page 215**


> Abandonment creates an “ambiguous loss.”5 Because death was not involved, there is no finality to your loss—no absolute closure. This delays the process of letting go. Ambiguity generates false hope and prolongs the agonizing period of searching and waiting. You wait for your lost love to return well beyond what your friends and family may deem appropriate.
**Page 216**


> You have two jobs with respect to abandonment grief. One is to accept the pain of loss. The other is to reverse the injury to your sense of self.

> Once again, the key to success lies in your ability to employ self-discipline—because you must prac- tice this exercise three times per day for several months to produce the changes you desire.
> Fortunately, Dream House is easy to do—even pleasurable. Once you learn the basics, it takes less than a minute each time. It can be practiced while doing other things, like driving the car, taking a walk, or getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.
> Dream House is a Gestalt exercise that I’ve modified to include some additional elements to direct your meditative and creative energies toward accomplishing life goals and increasing your sense of self. Fueled by the power of your imagination, this exercise facilitates the process by which you redirect the energy of your grief toward increasing your capacity for life and love on a daily basis: Akeru.
> The exercise involves conjuring up the Dream House, picturing yourself within it, and feeling grate- ful for the possibilities of life. That’s it. As long as you consistently practice it three times a day, you will begin to see major results within a few months, smaller ones even sooner. Your sense of self-worth improves, because you’re accomplishing things in the world and within yourself to help you feel good about yourself.

**Page 236**


> . Now, during the Rage stage, your embattled self finally stands up and says, “Enough! It’s not my fault. I don’t deserve this much pain!” This active resistance sends the energy back outward. Rage, then, is attachment energy that has rebounded against the self. It is attachment energy pushing outward, still seeking an object it can’t find, but no longer willing to take no for an answer, no longer willing to take it out on you.
**Page 237**


> You Rage because you feel deprived of the one commodity you need most: love. Rage thrusts for- ward to find it.
**Page 237**


> Rage occurs in two waves of arousal.2 When something first ticks you off—a date cancels, for exam- ple—you experience Wave One. Adrenaline and norepinephrine (NE) are released, and you feel an initial surge of aggressive energy. Wave One lasts for a few minutes—enough time for you to mobilize your energy for swift action (your mammalian brain assumes you’re in a life-and-death crisis). Wave Two occurs as your glucocorticoid stress hormones build up in your bloodstream, and its effect lasts for hours and even days. So, even after you’ve gotten past the initial urge to strike out, your body sustains a background tone of rage, keeping you in a constant state of action readiness. This background tone creates a foundation on which subsequent responses build more quickly.
**Page 238**


> Abandonment survivors tend to have trouble with anger. Some feel too needy and insecure to get in touch with healthy anger. The reason: Their fear of abandonment is so pervasive that they can’t tolerate any break in their connections. They’re afraid that expressing anger will cause others to pull away. Outer takes advantage of this fear and lack of assertiveness and gets you to take your anger out on yourself.
> It often manifests in convoluted ways.
**Page 240**


> Popular theory says that when people’s faults make you angry, it’s probably because they remind you of a quality in yourself you don’t like looking at. While this well-known aphorism may be true, there is a less-well-known reason as likely to be true: You become critically fixated on their faults because they are doing something that you would never accept in yourself.
**Page 242**


> The tendency to become negatively attracted to other people’s faults is another example of false attribution: you presume that someone else’s behavior is causing you to feel angry and critical. In fact, our own issues around complying with our own higher expectations are responsible for most of our frustration, anger, and intolerance toward someone else. The point is that catching yourself in The Critic role is always a self-awareness lesson. The lesson may be that you need to ease up on the stringency of your own rule book.

> The Fool is able to love for today, heedless of tomorrow’s heartbreak.
**Page 245**


> I think the body linguists have it wrong. They suggest that when we fold our arms, we’re keeping people out. We’re not. In holding ourselves, we are performing a gesture of self-acceptance, accepting ourselves as we are now in the moment. Wrapping our arms around ourselves is a way of gathering all that we’ve learned together with who we are and holding it to heart, embracing our self-wisdom.2 When such a gesture seems off-putting, it is probably when we use it defensively to protect ourselves from someone whose power seems threatening at the moment.
**Page 260**


> Perfectionism is a trait that runs through the lives of many abandonment survivors. It’s a source of self-sabotage because it predicates our success on a false solution, a solution that creates its own set of problems. Perfectionists are always raising the bar on themselves, turning life into a treadmill—despite their efforts, they can never reach satisfaction.
**Page 260**


> Abandonment survivors are convinced they can never be perfect enough to stave off the rejection or criticism they believe is their due.
**Page 260**


> Perfectionism creates unrealistic expectations, especially when it comes to recovery. You expect to grow in a straight line and accomplish the healing tasks once and for all—without error. Perfectionists think that to err is a weakness and they fault themselves for slipping back into negative emotions. Perfec- tionism makes it difficult to appreciate the true nature of achievement. Progress is usually accomplished by taking two steps forward, one step back.

> The key is to give yourself credit for doing the best you can. Vow to keep doing your best. When you slip, correct yourself and move forward.
**Page 261**


> Becoming realistic allows you to see back steps as part of the gait of progress. Progress is supposed to be slow, steady, and sporadic. When you slip back, rebalance yourself. Learn what you can from the experience, and propel your journey forward.

> When a lover arouses our fear of abandonment, a traumatic connection is created.3 Traumatic bonding is a highly prevalent condition in human relationships, es- pecially among abandonment survivors. It has an addictive biochemistry of its own, examples of which are found throughout the animal kingdom. For example, when a researcher steps on the toe of a duck- ling (ouch), it follows him (imprints) more closely than before.4 The hazing ritual involved in joining fraternities creates traumatic bonding, whereby the pain and humiliation inflicted on the new pledges increases their loyalty to the fraternal order. The famous Stockholm study5 provides another example in which bank hostages became steadfastly loyal and protective toward their captors.

> own actions. The fear created by abandonment doesn’t occur in a burst; it’s not over like it is when you’ve been startled. It occurs in a continuous flow over an extended period of time (or in pulsating waves). This may account for the loss of personal volition you experience when involved with a partner whose drinking, philandering, or emotional abuses chronically arouse your fear of abandonment.
**Page 263**


> Until you get a handle on what is driving you to stay connected, fear reinforces your need to hang on emotionally tighter than ever. You remain gripped in the compelling dynamics of traumatic bonding, that is, until you learn how to correct it.

> My life was now. I couldn’t prevent myself from wanting him. I could only end the agony of waiting by facing the fact that he wasn’t in my life now. For all I knew, tomorrow he might come back. Then again, he might not. The only thing that counted was that right now he wasn’t there. Facing this allowed me to start living now.”

> The metaphoric language of the wound describes what you’ve been through. During Shattering you felt the piercing pain as abandonment’s knife to the heart severed the tender tissues of your attach- ment. During Withdrawal your laceration remained open, raw, and festering, tormenting you with the nagging, pulling, and aching of love deprivation. During Internalizing, the wound became susceptible to infection, threatening to leave permanent scars on your self-esteem. During Rage, you felt burning agitation as the tender, taut tissues tried to mend over the wound. And now, during Lifting, your wound seals over, protecting the self from further injury. The danger is that calluses can form, causing numbing and sensitivity to the area, sealing in your self-doubt and sealing you off from your feelings once again

> How you handle residual feelings of abandonment—the insecurity, self-doubt, and depression— determines why some of you will be positively transformed, and others will become remote, detached, and less likely to reconnect than before.1

> The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.’

> Even in the height of intimacy we remain separate individuals. The sense we have of another is a matter of perception, colored by our needs, anx- ieties, and values. We construct subjective pictures in our minds to represent the other, but the idea of truly knowing another is an illusion.
**Page 280**


> Without proper direction, people surviving abandonment tend to overdefend themselves and let calluses form over their wounds, making it more difficult for others to get close. To prevent these cal- luses, remember that when you lift, take your feelings with you. They hold the key to meaningful con- nections to others. If you bury your emotions, those who try to connect to you are confronted with your outer shell, rather than your warm emotional center.

> Andrew Solomon writes,“Grief is profoundly important to the human condition....If we did not suffer enough loss to fear it, we would not love intensely.”3 Anyone who has endured serious heartbreak and learned to love again knows how true this statement is.

>  Clients complain: “But I don’t have anyone to love.” I answer: Yes, you do. You have yourself—
> They interrupt: “Don’t give me that love yourself crap. I want somebody special to love and for them to love me back.”
> My answer: Loving yourself comes first. But you’re right. It does not end there. It must extend to others.
**Page 287**


> Many people continue to focus their love efforts on making a connection with a significant other. This kind of connection is one of many ways to achieve greater life and love, but it is one of the most popular pursuits of abandonment survivors—finding someone special

> Most often our pain is about another person or not having a person in our lives.

> Cleansing: push your hands away from your chest.
> Attending: tilt your head to the side.
> Separating: lift your face.
> Beholding: lift your chest.
> Accepting: take a deep breath.
> Increasing Love: press the warmth of your palms into your heart. Letting: open your hand.

> Mental health and well-being are all about connection.
> Heartbreak is the antithesis because it is all about disconnection. Earlier, we talked about how when
> your relationship is torn, the wires get pulled apart and go off sparking. You feel the painful disconnect at every level—from yourself, from your emotions, from your hopes and dreams, from your adult con- trol of your behavior, and from love. Abandonment recovery provides the tools to reconnect the wiring and restore balance.

> abandoholic meant. “It’s when you get emotionally hooked on someone because he’s hard to get. The insecurity hooks you. And then you have the opposite response toward the available types. If you don’t feel that conquest fever, you have no interest.

> Graduating means you’re equipped with tools and insights to embark on a lifelong journey of connection.
**Page 309**


> Graduating from abandonment recovery is all about connection. It doesn’t mean just reconnecting old wires to old functions but creating new ones
**Page 309**


> If you are alone not by choice, making a connection to a higher purpose is particularly important, because you don’t have a re- lationship to medicate the pain coming from those unhooked wires. The tools of abandonment recovery are adequate to the task, but you may need more time to practice them on a daily basis. Six months to a year is probably a minimum for most people who are deeply entrenched in patterns of abandonment

> I understand that I have to connect to something important in myself and in my life— so that I can feel passionate about something that really matters,” says Jennifer. “But I still want a relation- ship. I want to be with somebody.”
**Page 309**


> The lingering grief of abandonment makes us feel unloved. This crushing feeling creates an urgent need to find a significant other.

> Think of love as an action rather than an overblown feeling that’s supposed to medicate you from your anxiety and emotional hunger
