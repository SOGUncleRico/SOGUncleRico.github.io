>The intimate link between sexuality and attachment is
eloquently described by the relational analyst Stephen Mitchell as
follows: Thus, sexuality plays a central role in most intimate
relationships. . . . it is establishment and maintenance of relatedness
that is fundamental, and the mutual exchange of intense pleasure
and emotional responsiveness is perhaps the most powerful medium
in which emotional connection and intimacy is sought, established,
lost and regained. [Mitchell, 1988: p. 107]

>Rachel links secure attachment to a capacity for intersubjective and
sustained intimacy, which she illustrates with a clinical vignette that is
reminiscent of what Stern et al. (1998) describes as a “moment of
meeting”. These moments are key to therapeutic change, the
consequences of which are a move to a new level in the therapeutic
relationship.

>As a teacher of deprived children and later as a child psychiatrist,
Bowlby became powerfully aware of the longing of young children for
the physical presence of their caregivers and of their corresponding traumatic
experiences of separation and loss. These perceptions laid the
empirical foundations of the theory.

>Like other relational theories, Attachment Theory has been criticized
for its failure to theorize these areas. Recently, however, it has come to
be understood that attachment is a bodily experience; it has always
been implicit in the basic premise of the child’s need for proximity to
the body of the mother. This recognition has, in turn, highlighted the
child’s sensual bond with the mother in influencing adult patterns of
sexuality. Indeed, within contemporary relational theories, sexuality
has come to be seen as the central arena in which the dramas of
attachment are played out—in which “emotional connection and
intimacy is sought, established, lost and regained” (Mitchell, 1988, p.
107).

>The maintenance of physical proximity by a young animal to a
preferred adult is found in a number of animal species. This suggested
to Bowlby that attachment behaviour has a survival value, the most
likely function of which is that of care and protection, particularly
from predators. It is activated by conditions such as sickness, fear,
and fatigue. Threat of loss leads to anxiety and anger; actual loss to
anger and sorrow. When efforts to restore the bond fail, attachment
behaviour may diminish, but will persist at an unconscious level and
may become reactivated by reminders of the lost adult, or new
experiences of loss.
>>Attachment theory’s basic premise is that, from the beginning of life,
the baby human has a primary need to establish an emotional
bond with a caregiving adult. Attachment is seen as a source of
human motivation as fundamental as those of food and sex. Bowlby
(1979, p. 129) postulated that Attachment behaviour is any form of
behaviour that results in a person attaining or maintaining proximity to
some other preferred and differentiated individual . . . While especially
evident during early childhood, attachment behaviour is held to
characterise human beings from the cradle to the grave.



>Attachment Theory highlights the importance of mourning in relation
to trauma and loss. An understanding of the relevance of this to
therapeutic practice was a vital element in the foundation of CAPP.

>It is the mother’s provision of a secure base to which the child can
return after exploration that enables the development of self-reliance
and autonomy.

>Mary Main, who was another Bowlby Lecturer

>Further support came from the perspective of infant observation and
developmental psychology developed by yet another Bowlby Lecturer,
Daniel Stern.

>2004 Bowlby lecturer Jody Messler Davies, who is co-editor of
Psychoanalytic Dialogues, has made seminal contributions to the
shaping of the American Relational model. Her highly influential book,
which she coauthored with Mary Gail Frawley, Treating the Adult
Survivor of Sexual Abuse (1994 Basic Books), was a pioneering
integration of trauma theory and relational psychoanalysis in the
treatment of sexual abuse. Their conceptualization of
transference–countertransference as the vehicle for expressing
dissociated traumatic experience was one of the firs clinical applications of this relational
approach. Since then she has extended these concepts in her original
exploration of the erotic dimension of the therapeutic relationship and
in her courageous development of the transformative uses of
countertransference disclosure.

therapeutic relationship, to be explored with openness and interest
without foreclosure.

>It would be impossible to be an effective clinician without a framework
for understanding and relating to our clients.

>In histories characterized by unrepaired losses, we found adults
suffering loneliness and isolation, anxious/insecure attachments

>Feelings of sexual desire provide an essential link between internal
and external; a passport to the outside world and part of the adult need
for attachment. Within an attachment framework we can then speak of
a sexuality of hope with an associated attachment dynamic affirming
our right to our subjectivity. And we can have similarly a sexuality of
despair, the sexuality of one whose subjectivity has been denied by
past and present attachment failure, a sadomasochistic sexuality that
denies the other their subjectivity.

>Four themes emerging from our collective clinical exploration

>>1. Sexual fantasies can be worked with by free association in the same
way we work with dreams. Exploration of a fantasy of being penetrated
by a woman with a penis uncovered past experience of humiliation at
the hands of a mother in a pattern of disorganized attachment where a
needed attachment figure is also a threatening one. In addition the
fantasy also represents a need to control a woman by having
something she wants (sex).

>>2. Strikingly, early abandonment and/or
unresolved losses lead to what one of us (BL) characterized as a
melancholy sexuality. Instead of a torrid jungle of untamed id drives,
the client suffers an arctic wasteland, cold and devoid of relationships.

>>3. In all attachment difficulties there can be a profound insecurity about
inhabiting one’s body, with all the implications this might have for a
person’s capacity for engaging in intimate sexual relationships.

>>4. In cases where strong erotic feelings are present in the consulting room
it is essential to be able to enjoy erotic feelings in the
countertransference without conflict or need. We also noted for future
work the important paper by Davies (1998) questioning whether there
is room for normal, non-countertransferential, adult sexual feelings in
the therapy relationship.


>where conflicted longings for
closeness can lead to needs for bodily affect regulation, such as
masturbation, to calm and soothe.

>Fairbairn’s clinical experience told him, at times quite forcefully in the
voice of his patient, that the human being was not pleasure seeking
but was object seeking: “You keep telling me I want this and that
instinct satisfied when what I really want is a father” (Fairbairn, 1946)

>pleasure seeking is a deterioration of object relationships.

>Boys are pressured/forced to move into a relational vacuum leading to
a tendency towards avoidant attachment, making for a tendency
towards relationless sexuality in adult life. Men tend to be pleasure
seeking in their sexual relationships as a consequence of the
deterioration of object relationships in their boyhood.

>In cases of anger, upset, jealousy, envy, the parent will sit with a child
explaining, helping to metabolize and effectively socializing these
feelings. Not so with childhood sexual feelings. We instruct our
children to make this exploration on their own. We have yet to understand the full clinical consequences of our culture’s
awkward silence on matters of childhood sexuality.

>The moral for us is that we should not be afraid of being wrong. Being
wrong is a good thing. In that spirit perhaps we can open up our files
and begin to discuss with each other, without a fear of being wrong

>We could think about it as a re-enactment of early insecure attachment
patterns: ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized; an attachment to a
bad object. For example, clients with an avoidant attachment pattern,
reflecting a fear that intimacy would be overwhelming. For some
people, when it comes to sex, even knowing someone’s real name can
feel suffocating, let alone experiencing a relationship or love. We might
think about this in relation to early experiences of being intruded on,
and misattuned to, with early bodily contact perhaps having been
about the other’s need for touch rather than a response to the infant’s
desire. It would be interesting to think about the insights from Susie
Orbach’s paper on Touch at last year’s conference in relation to this
(Orbach, 2004). And of course, sadomasochistic re-enactments are
very common for those whose attachment figures were sexually or
emotionally abusive.

>In a good-enough attachment, there is an experience of intimacy as a
relationship between two people, intersubjectivity, rather than a fear
that connection with the other’s mind and body will lead to “merger” or
abandonment.

>>What, then, is sex like in this context of intimacy, when there are two
subjects in a relationship? Being seen, recognized, desired, and
passionately loved for who you are? Standing naked before someone
who sees you and delights in what they fin there, and equally that you
look into their eyes and see them present, naked before you, and feel
that desire for who they are. But intimacy, intersubjectivity, feels
potentially overwhelming for clients who have never been seen, or
attuned to. A client I am currently working with, who has a history of
severe self-harm and inflicting extreme and tortuous experiences on
herself, believed herself to be inured to pain and fear. She could not understand her
response to the growing feelings of intimacy and warmth between us.
She said to me, “But I can handle everything—I’m not afraid of
anything—why can’t I handle this? I’m a nervous wreck in these
sessions”. Because she feels present, and feels a connection with me,
another presence. “When I’m with you, I feel like I don’t want to leave.
That’s wrong.”

>>Stern and others talk of intersubjectivity as a normal developmental
stage, but we must not imagine that this is an easy thing: to recognize
that there are other minds out there that I cannot control or predict,
that are different from me, that have their own centre of being, forever
separate from my own. This is a process of life-long developmental
learning. In a history of insecure attachment this is potentially

life-threatening; the other’s mind is not only separate and different, but
this difference is dangerous. And what if I do fin someone who can
bridge that separation without impinging on who I am? What if we do
recognize each other, believe in each other, and I lose you? How will I
bear that? Intimacy then becomes fraught—and seemingly impossible.
I’m reminded here of Wendy Cope’s very short poem, “Two Cures for
Love”: 1. Don’t see him. Don’t phone or write a letter. 2. The easy way:
get to know him better. [Cope, 1995] Really knowing someone here
would actually cure you of being “in love”. Romance and desire depend
on not knowing the other. Humorous though the poem is intended to
be, there is something deeply painful and terrified in what it assumes.
On the other hand beginning to experience sexuality in the context of
intersubjectivity in the consulting room is one of the most intense,
exciting, and powerful experiences I have ever had in my clinical work.

>There was no opportunity for transitional space to develop between us,
no chance for us both to be present as subjects and therefore, to be
found or seen. The possibility of intimacy opened up only when I
found my subjectivity in the room and was able to disentangle from
the re-enactments. No more games: me as a real person, who was hurt
and affected by her. I was not willing to do this any more—I would no
longer be an object.
>>The feelings of warmth and closeness that then grew between us were
at firs profoundly threatening to Ann, because she felt love for the firs
time, but she began to feel safe enough to begin to tolerate wanting,
desiring, and to begin to experience feelings of desire between us in
the room. For a client who had previously been unable to make eye
contact, there was now a session in which she just stared wordlessly
into my eyes, which was for her a profoundly erotic experience: she
could stay with feeling seen, present, loved, and desiring—two people,
separate and connected at the same time. There was now no escape
from the fact that she was her own subject experiencing her own
desire and I was mine, no way of breaching that separation of two

minds except by risking being present, being known, being open.
Terrifying, beautiful, profound, as hot and steamy as you could wish,
beyond a now moment, one of Stern et al.’s (1998) moments of
meeting.

>Attachment styles and the relational responses that are associated
with them will become increasingly prominent in the therapeutic
relationship as the survivor gets into working around memories of
trauma and danger.

>the key part of any therapeutic work is therapist’s use of self in the
task of creating safety and a secure base for the client so that the
tasks of mourning and re-connection can be addressed (Herman,
1992). This will almost inevitably draw out some of the
attachment-related strategies and responses, along with other
transference issues in the relationship (Purnell, 2004) that the
therapist will need to be equipped to deal with.
