>We cannot change what has been done to us, but we can refuse to be reduced by it. —Maya Angelou 


>We all operate in very personal and particular ways. From the
minute we are born, we begin to develop skills to survive childhood.
We come into this world with the innate expectation that someone will
meet our basic needs. That someone is the people who created us. We
expect that our mother and father will care for our needs and love us
unconditionally. In some cases, our primary caregivers will not be our
biological parents, however this expectation still applies. 


>Everything Bowlby observed and proposed was considered theory
until Giacomo Rizzolatti came along. Rizzolatti is a neurophysiologist
who discovered mirror neurons, cells in our brain that enable us to form
mental representations or images. This discovery substantiated what
Bowlby had observed. Mirror neurons cause our brains to light up when
we see someone doing an activity, as if we were actually doing the
activity ourselves. For example, when you watch a tennis match, the
area of your brain that would be active if you were actually playing
tennis lights up. Similarly, if a baby watches his mother play with a toy,
the part of the brain that would be active if the baby were actually
playing with the toy is stimulated. Did you ever wonder why you cry
while watching a sad scene in a movie? Mirror neurons! The “sad” area
of your brain is stimulated when you see another person in distress.
Ever wonder why we get turned on when we watch pornography? You
guessed it! Mirror neurons. So the next time your partner says that he
didn’t feel a thing after watching that sex scene, you can say, “Don’t lie
to me. I know all about your mirror neurons!” Your subsequent
conversation about mirror neurons will no doubt extinguish any prior
brain activation.
>
>Rizzolatti was able to show that mirror neurons, or mirror brain
cells, are stimulated and subsequently affected by the actions of others.
Mirror neurons help explain why we grow up and repeat what we
witnessed our parents doing. 



>If your caregiver was insensitive to your
feelings, perhaps because she was never taught how to deal with her
own feelings, you got the message that emotions are somehow wrong,
scary, and bad. At the sign of any emotions, you become anxious, or
you will unknowingly push them down and throw them into your
“internal basement” by minimizing them, ignoring them, or completely
dissociating yourself from them. Emotions, then, become these looming
scary things that you have no idea what to do with. But because
emotions automatically come with being human, they come out
anyway, and, at times, in the most inappropriate ways. 



>When children are able to identify their feelings and work through
them, they don’t have to overreact or suppress them and can deal with
them in healthy ways. One of the best and most useful gifts parents can
give children is showing them how to identify their feelings, which is
done simply by validating what a child is feeling. This process helps
the child identify and name his emotions. Saying to a child, “Did that
scare you?” “That must have been so frustrating,” or “I bet that made
you sad” validates the experience the child is having. On the other
hand, saying, “That’s not scary,” “Don’t let that bother you,” or “He
didn’t mean it” causes a child to become confused and not trust what he
is in fact feeling. 


>Validating someone’s feelings, whether a child or an adult, allows the person to
feel understood and connected, which more often than not calms the
person down. The calmness comes from that feeling of connection and
being fully understood by another human being—what Daniel Stern
calls attunement.


>Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp has studied emotions extensively. He defines them as our ability to subjectively experience different states of our nervous system. Since emotions are a part of being human, if we have not developed the ability to recognize them, we have instead developed the ability to push them deep inside and ignore them. There is no such thing as not having feelings, which is easy to understand if you look at feelings or emotions as simply your nervous system being out of balance. The question then becomes, “How do I get back to baseline without freaking out or having to ignore my emotions?” 


>If your words cause another human being to feel “felt,” you are creating a bond, which is at the core of attachment.



>People with secure attachment can tolerate disagreements and know they won’t be
abandoned. They know that someone can be angry with them but still
love them at the same time, and they have the capacity to do the same. 


> For the avoidant, being around people causes anxiety, because at any time, someone will figure
out how defective they really are. These seeds were planted long ago
and have nothing to do with how much they love their partner.
However, when a partner doesn’t have this information, they can’t help
but take it personally. 

>*Earned Secure Attachment*
>
>There is good news! Neurobiologists have discovered that we can
change our brains, create new neural pathways, and learn to treat
ourselves with love and compassion. We can learn to trust others, the
world, and ourselves. We can make sense of what happened to us as
children and know that the way we were treated stems from our
caregivers’ shortcomings and is not an indication of our worth. We can
learn how to regulate our emotions and go from a dysregulated state to 
a regulated state without our world coming undone. We can learn to
respond and not react and to form healthy relationships that are
supportive and reciprocal. This is referred to as earned secure
attachment. In later chapters, I will teach you techniques to help you
attain earned secure attachment and become the human being you want
to be.





>There is a difference between an automatic reaction, which is mostly unconscious and is based on how
your brain was programmed by childhood experiences, and a wellthought-out response, which is conscious and based on who you truly are and what you want in your life today as an adult. 






>Just validate my feelings, and I’ll be okay!


>When danger is not immediate, if you can keep your thinking brain engaged, you can “short-circuit” the debilitating threat response, stop yourself from reacting, choose an appropriate response, and get yourself back to a balanced state.


>systematic desensitization, where you use short exposures to the feared object to diminish the fear. 



>If you are an avoidantly attached adult, you may be extremely
linear, logical, and literal because your right hemisphere is
underdeveloped. Your capacity for encoding autobiographical
memories, a right-hemisphere function, is impaired, which explains
why people on the avoidant side of the attachment continuum have a
difficult time remembering their childhoods and often complain of
having a terrible memory in general. People with avoidant attachment
tend to be left-brain dominant, and people with ambivalent attachment
tend to be right-brain dominant.
>
>In ambivalent attachment, the right side of the brain is being
stimulated because the mother does interact with the infant, at times
being sensitive to what he needs. However, the mother is also insensitive
and intrusive, and at times she disengages and becomes distant and
unavailable. This situation is very frustrating and confusing for the
infant, who becomes clingy in order to not miss an opportunity for
attention from the mother, since he never knows when it will come. This
devastating fear overwhelms the right brain. Continued experiences of
this type dampen the development of the left brain during critical periods
of left brain development. Consequently, the left brain’s ability to calm
down the right side is impaired.

>However, repair works at any age and with any relationship. It is akin to owning mistakes in the moment and validating someone’s feelings




>This switch from hyperarousal to hypoarousal, or dissociation, occurs when the infant’s brain determines that there is impending danger that cannot be avoided and there is no way to escape. Helplessness sets in, and the infant surrenders to it in an effort to detach from an unbearable situatio




>If this sequence happens often enough—fear, crying, no one comes to sooth him—the infant begins to believe that he is helpless and will stop trying to better his situation by bringing attention to himself by crying. “I am helpless to whatever my environment brings” becomes a core belief that the passage of time will not change.


>Constant worry without an opportunity for rest prevents the brain from strengthening its “calm” circuits, diminishing its ability to tolerate a calm, regulated state. If your childhood was full of worry, or if you weren’t taught how to calm down, you have a huge capacity for anxiety. Even though it doesn’t feel good, it is a familiar state of mind. Your capacity for a calm state of mind is limited. You must build up or expand your “container” for a calm state in order to tolerate it. In extreme cases, some people experience relaxation-induced anxiety. They are so used to feeling anxious that feeling calm, even for a little while, will in and of itself cause them to jump back into anxiety.


>Infants and children who are being primed for avoidant attachment
have caregivers who are not there physically and/or emotionally. To
protect themselves, they learn to bypass hyperarousal or attempts to get
their mother’s attention and automatically go into hypoarousal, or
shutdown. They stop trying to use others to help them feel safe and
instead dissociate from their feelings to cut themselves off from intense
emotions that they do not know what to do with or how to navigate
through. This process causes an erroneous belief that they don’t have
needs or emotions, and do not need anyone for connection or to provide
comfort. 






>But avoiding emotional dysregulation does not give the brain an opportunity to develop the circuits necessary to transition from dysregulated states to regulated states with ease.







>When the parents comes in, the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system is stimulated, sending a signal of relief throughout the infant’s body: “Yes! I’m safe! Thank you, thank you, Mommy and Daddy!” But when the parents leave again, within seconds, the sympathetic branch of the nervous system is stimulated, sending the signal: “Oh no! Why did they leave? I’m scared! I’m scared! I’m in danger!” This process sends such confusing and conflicting signals to the infant that it is no wonder he collapses and dissociates after a few days of this method. 




>Socially isolating is a way to keep ourselves in a regulated state. In other words, if we do not engage with others, we do not have to worry about dealing with the anxiety that shyness can bring, or the emotions that misunderstandings can create.






>Cutting can also be a form of regulating the nervous system. Physical injury releases endorphins, our brain’s natural painkillers, and induces a pleasant feeling, providing a temporary relief from intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, and stress. People who describe a feeling of emptiness or emotional numbness may use cutting as a way to stimulate their nervous systems to feel something.


>Somatic Experiencing Therapy



>Implicit memories do not feel like memories because we are not conscious of them, so we do not realize that we are reacting to a memory in addition to a new event.



>Being stuck in the flight response: People stuck in the flight response will make references to running away, escaping, and wanting to hide.


>When I lose it, I know that repair is just as important as my initial
reaction. Having the expectation of never getting triggered again,
because theoretically I have the knowledge to get past it, sets me up to
fail. I am who I am, came from where I came from, and was wired the
way I was wired. It takes time to rewire the brain, and I know I
contribute to that every time I respond differently than I would have
before I had this information—when I was sleepwalking through life.
The important thing is acknowledging how often it is not happening
versus the fact that it still happens on occasion. 

>Because the information stored in our implicit memory
banks is out of our conscious awareness, virtually anything can set the
alarms off. Add to that the fact that stimulation of the sympathetic
nervous system is involuntary—in other words, we cannot control when
it gets activated—and this can be a recipe for disaster. The good news is
that we can control calming it down once we notice it has been
activated, giving us a better chance of choosing a response and not
reacting without thought. This is key. Tools to help you notice your body
and calm down are provided in chapter 5. It is imperative that you
become familiar with what makes you tick and why. The more you know
about yourself, your attachment style, your brain, how your nervous
system works, and the defenses you have developed given your
experiences in life, the more you will be able to prevent being hijacked
by your amygdala. 





>Trauma researchers agree that trauma is not in the event itself. An experience becomes traumatic when it overwhelms a person’s capacity to cope, stimulating the primitive part of the brain to go into fight, flight, or freeze mode.



>Low frequency sounds or deep tones are interpreted by our nervous system as predatory and cause us to feel an urge to run away or brace for possible danger.



>You may have chosen someone who has traits that are similar to one or both of your parents in an unconscious effort to resolve childhood issues. This happens because our brains like what is familiar, even if it attracts us to situations that aren’t healthy, such as the woman who grows up with an alcoholic father and then marries an alcoholic.

>Working through past trauma and learning better ways to cope with stress can reduce the unconscious need for defense mechanisms.

>Denial: This is a refusal to admit or accept reality. People with avoidant attachment are prone to using denial when it comes to feelings. Keep in mind that needs and feelings get buried deep inside because there was no one around to help a child navigate through them. “I’m okay,” “It’s no big deal,” and “It is what it is” are common sayings from those on the avoidant attachment continuum who use denial as a defense. Many times, people become so good at burying their feelings that they really don ’t feel.




>In extreme cases, people with an avoidant attachment style might dissociate from their needs and feelings. As adults, they do not feel the need to connect with others. They isolate from people, living a loner existence.

>**Projection:** This is when we put our unconscious thoughts or
feelings onto others. If I am angry with you but unconsciously do not
feel safe enough to admit it, or don’t even know the anger is there, I
might accuse you of being angry with me. This accusation will most
likely start a fight, thus allowing me to get my anger out in an indirect
way. People also use projection when they cannot admit something
about themselves that they dislike and thus project it onto someone else
as a characteristic the other person possesses. If I am very critical but
unable to admit it, I might accuse you of being overly critical, even
when you’re not.
>
>Jealousy is a form of projection. If I have an unconscious fear that I
am not good enough to be loved, I may accuse you of flirting, being too
friendly with others, or downright cheating on me. Someone with an
ambivalent attachment style is prone to feel jealous given their fear of
being abandoned. Paranoia is also a form of projection. If my amygdala
is on overdrive and I am on constant “tiger watch,” I might project a
belief onto people that they are out to get me, when it’s just good old
Francois Amygdala (see chapter 2) working overtime. 


>Thankfully, becoming healthy does not require uncovering everything that is repressed, but it does require noticing when we have a reaction to something—when we have been triggered—so that we can choose how to respond to it, rather than becoming aware of the reaction after the fact, without a sense of how we got there.








>**Intellectualization:** This involves removing all emotions from an emotional experience. For example, you might be given the diagnosis of cancer and instead of allowing yourself to feel sadness and anger, you jump into learning about cancer from an objective perspective. You explore every possible cure, whether helpful or not. This is not to say that being informed is a bad idea, but a balance of allowing the feelings and exploring the medical possibilities proves to be the healthiest response. People with avoidant attachment are prone to use this defense mechanism.


>When you rationalize, you’re just missing out on the important step of acknowledging the feelings associated with an experience.


>Defense mechanisms are not always dysfunctional. Some defense mechanisms, such as sublimation and compensation, can be healthy ways of dealing with thoughts, urges, and feelings.






>There are four basic fears—fear of failure, fear of success, fear of abandonment, and fear of engulfment.

>Parents who did too much for you and never let you do anything on
your own may have unknowingly planted a belief that you are not
capable of doing anything for yourself. In this situation, fear of failure
becomes overwhelming, because you have never had a chance to
experience failure and realize that you can survive it. Fear of failure can
also stem from the fear of being rejected. It is not a stretch to say that
no one likes failure, even though some of the most profound learning
can come from failing or being rejected. However, from a survival
standpoint, successful people get all the attention and glory. People
want to be around them, and survival is more likely in groups.
Rejection brings with it the fear of being alone: “If I fail, no one will
like me. If no one likes me, I will die alone.” Best-selling business
author Seth Godin says, “The cost of failure is not that a saber-toothed
tiger will eat you . . . the cost of failure is nothing.” Godin understands
how the brain perceives failure as a serious concern, with life-or-death
consequences. Remember, the brain likes what’s familiar. If working
through feelings of disappointment is not familiar, the brain can’t be
sure the process won’t be life threatening, thus causing panic. Fear of
failure, however, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you are too
overwhelmed with fear to try, you will stop yourself from moving
ahead. You will feel like a failure when you see everyone around you
progressing, paralyzing yourself even further. 



>When your core belief is that you are bad or defective, reaching
success is going to require you to redefine yourself and change the core
belief about your worth and sense of belonging in the world. Otherwise,
self-sabotage will be your unwelcome companion. Some people reach
success only to sabotage themselves and lose it all. Others reach success
and retain it, but they never embrace it because they feel uncomfortable
and guilty for having it. 



>**Fear of Engulfment**
>
>People on the avoidant side of the continuum can usually relate to
fear of engulfment. Children who have been neglected develop a belief
that they are damaged goods. Being around people causes anxiety
because the more they are around people, the more likely their
defectiveness will be found out. Additionally, because they were left
alone a lot, being alone becomes familiar and comfortable.
Consequently, they tend to be loners or at the very least really enjoy
and feel relaxed being by themselves. Fear of engulfment can also stem
from having to submerge your own identity, needs, sense of worth, or
personal safety because your parent took up all the space and needed all
the attention. There was no room for you or your needs. This situation
causes a severe mistrust of people and their intentions. Consequently,
being around people increases anxiety. Fear of engulfment can also be
brought on by parents who are controlling, smothering, or extremely
overprotective. Consequently, an exaggerated need to have your own
space, your own stuff, and privacy become high priorities. 


>Behavior that compels us to approach or avoid begins to make sense
when you recognize that the nervous system is innately programmed to
keep us safe from that lurking tiger, which now may exist only in our
minds. This danger actually did exist when we were infants, toddlers,
and children if our primary caregivers did not provide the safe
environment we needed to thrive and move through our developmental
stages with ease and expertise. This early environment and its side
effects become such well-traveled paths in our brains, that as adults we
continue to live as if we are still bound by the chains of our past. Our
interactions become unconscious negotiations of safety or danger,
approach or avoid.





>The truth is that even if you fail, succeed, get abandoned, or feel engulfed, you will be able to handle it. You just need the tools to do so. You can’t build a house without a hammer.

>Forgive yourself for what you didn’t know. Do not continue where your parents left off. You are an adult now who gets to choose exactly how you want to live. Begin to explore that choice and the possibilities it brings.
