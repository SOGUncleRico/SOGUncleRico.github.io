>This journey requires work. At times it will feel challenging, especially when you are asked to examine unhealthy thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. The exercises contained in this book are designed to help you get closer to the healthy relationships that you desire. You will need to keep a journal to complete the exercises and track your progress. There are three options available to you: (1) purchase a journal or notebook, (2) access the online journal on my website (http://www.michelleskeen.com) or an online journal from another site, or (3) download the PDFs that are provided for each of the exercises (found at http://www.love medontleaveme.com) and keep them in a notebook or binder. The act of writing helps you stay focused, and having the information
in one place allows you the opportunity to notice behavioral pat- terns, reflect on your values and experiences, and chart your progress. You may go through periods when you feel stuck or challenged; these are the times when it’s helpful to have a record of your journey so you can look back at what you’ve written and celebrate the progress that you’ve made.
I wear a bracelet that reads, “It matters not what road you take but what you become on the journey.” Let’s begin the journey.... (4-5)

>As an infant, if you are left—abandoned—you will not survive. Your life, your survival, depends upon another person. To feel anxious and insecure about your primary relationship is frightening. This fear eclipses everything in your life—if you are focused on your survival you probably don’t have the capacity to focus on other things, and you certainly don’t have the luxury of responding to stressful situations with an ability to manage your impulses and desires. Every stressful situation is a life-threatening crisis to the insecurely attached child. There isn’t time to weigh thoughtful options to cultivate a response. You must react quickly and automatically. 13

>Individuals who struggle with BPD tend to be more tuned in to sensory stimuli in their environment. 13

>In this case, your core beliefs are basically negative ideas that you form about yourself and other people based on how you were treated growing up and the messages that you received. These negative ideas are painful and pack a big emotional wallop every time they get triggered. 15

>The problem arises when you have a negative belief about yourself and your monologue contains negative self-talk—your behavior is going to reflect that. This is how we get in and stay in an unhelpful behavioral-response cycle with our core beliefs (more about this in chapter 3). 16

>The four core beliefs that can trigger the fear of abandonment or be triggered by the fear of abandonment are mistrust and abuse, emotional deprivation, defectiveness, and failure. 16

>>Emotional Deprivation - “I feel like I was raised by loving parents, but I don’t feel like I get the love that I need. And I don’t have a person in my life that is tuned in to my feelings and understands me.” 34

>>Abandonment Core Belief
With an abandonment core belief your thoughts may include:
People who love me will leave me or die. No one has ever been there for me. The people I’ve been closest to are unpredictable. In the end I will be alone.

>>Emotional Deprivation Core Belief
If you have an emotional deprivation core belief your thoughts may include: I feel lonely. I don’t get the love that I need. I don’t have anyone in my life who really cares about me or meets my emotional needs. I don’t feel emotionally connected to anyone.

>>Defectiveness Core Belief
If you have a defectiveness core belief your thoughts may include: If people really knew me they would reject me. I am unworthy of love. I feel shame about my faults. I present a false self because if people saw the real me they wouldn’t like me. 21






>Core beliefs are also predictive—you use the beliefs that were formed based upon your past experiences to predict the future of a relationship. Again, this is another area where we can affect change. Core beliefs are triggered by stressful social situations and interactions. And core beliefs are highly emotional—when triggered they produce strong feelings of fear, shame, anxiety, despair, depression, loss, grief, and so on. There are tools in this book that will help you understand and manage these unavoidable painful emotions. 42





>The emotional part of our brain hijacks the rational part of our brain—amygdala hijack! Coined by Daniel Goleman in his book Emotional Intelligence (2006), amygdala hijack works like this: when we experience powerful emotions— like fear—it overwhelms our rational thoughts, and this can lead to behavior that is harmful to us rather than helpful. 45

>So how does this relate to core beliefs? When we’re in a situation or engaging in an interaction and a look, words, or an action trigger one of our core beliefs, our memories get activated, and that releases a powerful dose of negative emotions that fuels our fight, flight, or freeze response. This system that’s hardwired in us is actually creating relationship problems: we’re behaving as if there is a threat of death when it’s really emotional harm—sure, it makes us feel bad, but it’s not going to kill us. 45
The abandonment core belief is easily triggered because it is deeply embedded in our survival instinct. Some of your behavioral triggers may include:

>>    • A change in someone’s behavior (e.g., he usually texts you or calls you every day and then you don’t hear from him for a day)
    • You aren’t getting the reassurance that you need
    • The other person has relationships that feel threatening to your relationship
    • Any behavior that can be interpreted as rejecting (e.g., a shorter than normal phone call; a tone of voice that is flat, bored, sarcastic, or angry; the other person is distracted while you’re having a conversation; canceling or rescheduling plans)
    • Periods of separation—explained and unexplained
    • A change in mood
    • An argument
    • Any behavior that you experience as a disconnection



>When your core beliefs get triggered by a person, a situation, or an event, your story comes alive just like the scene in the snow globe comes to life when you shake it. You experience a very intense intolerable negative emotional reaction. It’s an emotional shortcut to the source of your core beliefs, and you will engage in a behavioral reaction to protect yourself.  66



>When your core beliefs get triggered you are in an emotional fog—you are suddenly unable to see helpful options and so you default to your old fear-based behavioral reactions. You may lash out, withdraw, become clingy or demanding, or self-soothe with drugs, food, or alcohol. You can’t stop the thoughts that emerge when you get triggered (e.g., “He’s going to leave me,” “I’m not good enough,” “I’ll never get the love I want”), but you can stop your behavioral reactions. When your core beliefs get triggered and you are blinded by the fog of negative emotions and thoughts, acknowledge their presence and wait for the fog to clear so that you can choose a helpful behavioral option. 74



>Mindfulness is an opening experience that gets us out of our limited mindset and perspective on our experiences and allows us to make a behavioral choice rather than defaulting to habitual behaviors. 77




>Mindfulness and Relationships
You can adopt a mindfulness approach to dealing with your relationship experiences. When you are mindful and you bring aware- ness to your experience you can stop your habitual behavioral reaction cycle. When you are in a situation that’s triggering your core beliefs—activating your story, or shaking up the snow in your snow globe—you can stop and recognize that you are having an intense emotional reaction accompanied by some unhelpful thoughts and uncomfortable body sensations. You will be able to stay with the experience, wait for the intensity of the feelings to decrease, and then make a mindful choice based upon what you know to be true instead of the shadows on the wall. The truth is that your story isn’t relevant in this moment and you are not in a life-threatening situation—your survival is not in jeopardy. By watching and waiting with patience, curiosity, openness, and com- passion you can put distance between yourself and your habitual behavioral reactions. The behavioral cycle that seems to make sense in the moment, when you’re experiencing the fear of abandonment, is unhelpful. You react to protect yourself, but you end up feeling worse and potentially damaging your relationships. 80




>Your beliefs about yourself are powerful, and, as you learned in previous chapters, there is no avoiding the negative self-talk. So what are you supposed to do with the pain? You can’t eliminate your core beliefs—they’ve been with you for a long time. You can’t avoid situations where you might get triggered. So what can you do when it seems like every- thing is out of your control?
Well, not everything is out of your control—you can control your responses to the triggers. Yep, that’s the answer! You may be asking yourself, Is it really that simple? Well, yes and no. Change takes work and commitment. It becomes easier to make the commitment and do the work when you accept what you can’t change and you get in touch with your values (more about this later in this chapter). 86


>ACT is not focused on eliminating core beliefs or the pain that comes with core beliefs. The goal is to learn to respond differently when core beliefs get triggered. 86



>Your efforts to avoid core belief–related pain created additional problems and suffering. These may include: isolating yourself from others, lashing out in anger, leaving before you can be left, and controlling others (to name a few). Do you recognize that everything you’ve tried in order to control and minimize core belief–related pain hasn’t worked? So, if running from the inevitable and unavoidable pri- mary pain hasn’t worked—and you know it hasn’t—can you consider an alternative? What if I told you not to run away? What if I told you that the answer lies in the pain? What if I told you to stop struggling and fighting and to let yourself feel the difficult emotions connected to your core beliefs? This is the one time that I am going to tell you to give up and admit defeat. Your old ways of fighting this inherent, inevitable, and unavoidable pain haven’t worked and they never will.




>This is a big pill to swallow. You might be feeling sad that you have to accept this pain in your life and that there is no way that you can control it. But here’s the good news—all of your behavioral reactions that you have used to combat core belief–related painful emotions aren’t needed anymore! Doesn’t it feel good to get rid of an ineffective and emotionally exhausting bag of tricks? 88
The sky is always there, holding the constantly changing weather. The weather can be stormy, dark, cloudy, snowy, rainy, sunny, or windy. While wind, storms, rain, and sunshine come and go, the sky remains the same, receiving each change with willingness. So imagine that the sky is the self—holding an endless stream of ever-changing private events. Now imagine yourself accepting and observing your emotions the way in which the sky accepts and observes the weather. Could you observe all of your “weather” without struggling or trying to change it? Could you observe the sensations in your body, the thoughts in your head, and the emotions that surge up and recede? Difficult thoughts and painful emotions that surface when your core beliefs get triggered are like a bad storm. But the storm will die down—it will pass and in time the air will clear.




>Now, you might be wondering what is going to keep you on this new path. What will prevent you from going back to your familiar coping behaviors? You have the freedom to make a choice about how you want to handle a situation when your core beliefs get triggered and you are flooded with negative emotion (fear, sadness, etc.) and catastrophic thoughts (“He’s going to leave me,” “I’m going to die alone,” etc.). Will you do what you’ve done before? I suspect that your habits haven’t worked for you or you wouldn’t be reading this book. So, do you try something new? There is no right or wrong, no good or bad. It’s about the result. If you are dissatisfied with your results it’s time to try something new. The answer is: you need to behave in ways that bring you closer to your goals. It is time to identify your values.




>Naming Your Thoughts
Your core belief–driven thoughts probably enter your mind frequently, particularly when you are experiencing a core belief–triggering event. You can’t get rid of them, so let’s try di using them by simply naming them.
Use your journal to record a list of your recurring unhelpful thoughts (“I’m afraid one day I will wake up and he will be gone,” “I worry about revealing my true self,” etc.). After each thought label or name it. Try different techniques: call it for what it is (“ it is my thought that one day I will wake up and he will be gone”), give it a label (“ it is my defectiveness thought”), or categorize it by core belief (abandonment, mistrust and abuse, emotional deprivation, defectiveness, or failure). 101




>When you make a mistake— and you will—acknowledge the mistake without judgment, accept the pain without struggle, care about yourself, comfort yourself, and stay in the moment with your experience rather than using it to keep your stories from the past alive or fuel your catastrophic stories about the future (e.g., “No one will ever love me,” “In the end I will be alone,” “I’ll never be good enough to be loved.”)




>When you make a mistake— and you will—acknowledge the mistake without judgment, accept the pain without struggle, care about yourself, comfort yourself, and stay in the moment with your experience rather than using it to keep your stories from the past alive or fuel your catastrophic stories about the future (e.g., “No one will ever love me,” “In the end I will be alone,” “I’ll never be good enough to be loved.”) 111




>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again—pain is unavoidable. It is part of the human condition. However, pain’s two-headed step- sister, suffering, is avoidable. You control when and where you experience suffering. If you cope with your pain by engaging in unhelpful (maladaptive) coping behaviors then you will create suffering. The goal is to manage the pain using healthy actions. Play it right and you never have to experience suffering—you can eliminate it from your life. It’s in your control. It’s time to identify some healthy and helpful coping behaviors that you can use when you get triggered and feel overwhelmed by negative emotion.
Imagine driving on the freeway when suddenly you enter a patch of fog that prevents you from seeing the road or any cars around you. Would you keep driving 65 miles per hour or would you slow down, pull over, and wait for the fog to clear? Most likely you would slow down and pull over, because maintaining your current speed under those conditions would be risky and harmful.
Now imagine yourself entering a thick fog of overwhelming negative emotions. Mindfully slowing down, pulling over, and waiting until the fog has cleared before getting back to the situation you are facing. While you are waiting for the fog of painful feelings to subside, you can engage in a distracting activity. When you get back on the road, you know that you have allowed the emotional fog to clear; you can return to the situation before you knowing that you have minimized or avoided any additional problems.




>Distracting activities are not about trying to avoid or escape your emotions; they are about allowing the fog to lift so you can see more clearly.





>You probably noticed that it was challenging for you to resist the impulse to engage in your automatic (unhelpful) coping responses. It’s understandable that it took more energy and more effort to engage in your helpful coping behaviors. As you access your healthy coping strategies more frequently, they will become your new automatic coping behaviors. It will take time, but your impulse to engage in unhelpful reactions will transition to an impulse to engage in helpful behaviors. You will continue to have positive reinforcing experiences and emotions following the use of your helpful behaviors. You will feel better about yourself because you will be engaged in values-based behavior, and you will have healthier interactions with others.

>Let’s look at a skill that is helpful when you find yourself stuck in a pattern of behavior that isn’t getting you where you want to be. It’s a skill that can help Claire and you—it’s called do the oppo- site. This is a DBT skill created by Marsha Linehan (1993). The idea is that you are choosing a behavior that is the opposite of your automatic response to your negative thoughts and emotions.




>One of the most well-known and entertaining examples of do the opposite is from a Seinfeld episode called “The Opposite.” Here’s the setup: George complains to Jerry that ”It’s just not working.” When Jerry asks what “it” is that isn’t working, George explains that his life hasn’t turned out the way he expected. He had so much promise—he was personable, bright, and perceptive. But it has just become clear to him that every decision he’s ever made in his life has been the wrong decision; every instinct that he has in every aspect of his life has been wrong. Now, his life is the opposite of everything that he wants it to be. In response, Jerry says, “If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.” George takes these words to heart and is determined to do the opposite in an effort to turn his life around.



> I demand reassurance. I need certainty about the future.



> Improved Communication—disclosure is a feedback loop: with dis- closure you get disclosure. When you make yourself vulnerable, open yourself to another person, it makes others feel like they can do the same with you. The breadth and depth of communication expands. Both of you feel free to share your thoughts and feelings about a range of topics, from the latest installment of my guilty- pleasure reality show to the homeless problem in San Francisco (that’s me disclosing a part of my hidden self).





>Validation is a term that most of us are familiar with. But what does it really mean and why is it an important component in building healthy communication? Verbal and nonverbal validation expresses to the other person that you are listening and understanding what he or she is saying, feeling, and doing. It does not mean that you agree or disagree. Validating another person is communicating that you understand his or her experience and accept it as legitimate. To get to this place you may need to gently ask questions to explore the other person’s thoughts and feelings.




>Validation is an important communication skill for you to learn because it creates a healthy cycle of verbal exchange. When someone expresses her thoughts and feelings—and she is met and acknowledged without an argument, anger, judgment, or hurt by another person—it has a soothing effect, which can reduce negative affect and increase positive feelings of trust and closeness.
Furthermore, validation increases self-disclosure. If you are practicing self-disclosure and the other person acknowledges your thoughts and feelings, even asking clarifying questions to better understand something you’ve said, you are more likely to engage in more self-disclosure. When you feel validated it’s easier to disclose private information.
