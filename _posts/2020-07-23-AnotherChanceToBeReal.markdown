>consistent relational experiences of the kinds that we saw with Zoey and Matthew and even Stephan (when his father was allowed to look at him). The result is often a developmental detour or arrest. When the parent cannot take cues from the baby, respond to the baby’s emotional state in helpful ways, allow the baby to disconnect and reconnect at will, or restore relatedness when

>within the prefrontal lobe, approximately behind the eye, this is the only cortical structure that has direct access to the subcortical limbic structures that play a crucial role in emotional, motivational, and relational processes (Schore, 1994). In this regard, Masterson (2005) proposes that “a center emerges in the prefrontal orbital cortex in the right brain for the control of emotion and emotional relationships, and is, therefore, a neurobiologic center of the self” (p. 10). It has been suggested (Masterson, 2005; Schore, 1994; Siegel, 1999) that most of the growth and differentiation of this particular brain structure occurs between the ages of 10 and 18 months (before the development of the conscious, rational left brain) and that it is enormously influenced by the interactive experiences with the primary caregiver. So, this center of the self forms nonconsciously, prerationally, and neurobiologically—in relationship.

>We do not suggest that insecure attachment is synonymous with psychopathology. We do contend, however, that all personality disorders reflect insecure attachment strategies and that they are the result of severe attachment and separation deviations.

>He understands the narcissistic and related disorders to opeate from an internal model in which mirroring, idealization, and adoration are the basis for feeling connected to another.

Page 41

>That is, the child with a nascent borderline personality disorder is forced to attune to the mother and follow her lead to stay connected.
Page 42

>If the only way for the child to reconnect after the disruption of a relationship is to focus on the mother and comply with her wishes, the child’s own feelings and urges must be ignored.
Page 42

>In contrast, esteem-sensitive people fear that “who they are as a person is not enough to make them lovable. Therefore, to protect themselves from abandonment they must prove that they are special through performance and achievement” (Cooper et al., 2005, p. 10). And separation-sensitive individuals “believe that to avoid abandonment, they must focus on what others want, need, and feel, while disavowing their own wants, needs and feelings. The underlying belief is that if they act on their own behalf, they will be abandoned”.

>expression of the real self results in punishment or the withdrawal of emotional support—in either case, there is a loss of connection to the object.
Page 44

>Siegel (1999) notes that “these dreaded states are not merely uncomfortable and disliked; they can feel like a black hole, a bottomless pit of despair, in which the self is lost for what seems to be forever”.
Page 44

>The primary motivation for defense in these people is the maintenance of attachment and affect regulation (avoidance of the abandonment depression), but the defenses that they typically enlist tend to be maladaptive in that they inhibit or disallow the experience or expression of the real self.
Page 45

>require that the child overinvest in the other at the cost of real self-expression and real self-development.
Page 45

>expression of the real self—including initiative, perseverance, sticking up for one’s self in a conflict, and even participation in therapy—will evoke separation anxiety or an abandonment depression; the experience is followed by defenses that mute the misery of the ensuing depression and anxiety. Succinctly stated, self-activation leads to an abandonment experience, which leads to defense. This sequence can be seen repeatedly in the treatment hour, and it haunts the daily lives of borderline patients.
Page 46

>Of course, such behavior is neither volitional nor conscious; it is a function of implicit relational knowledge, a reflexive and survival-driven effort to regulate affect by maintaining or reestablishing a connection with the object. As we demonstrate later, effective intervention requires that the therapist and patient identify and curtail the maladaptive defenses and recognize the purpose they serve in the context of the triad of the disorders of the self. Ultimately, if all goes well, the patient will achieve more adaptive means of managing unpleasant feeling states than through this sequence of autonomy, depression, and defense.
Page 47

>This dynamic is seen frequently in the psychotherapy setting—for instance, when the patient makes a wrathful attack on the therapist in one session but returns to the next one acting as if that same therapist can do no wrong—with no apparent awareness of the remarkable discontinuity in one’s own behavior.
Page 48

>The more alone, inadequate, and frightened the child feels, the more imperative it becomes to establish a connection or reconnection, and the only conceivable means for doing so is activation of the rewarding object relations unit or the withdrawing unit.
Page 52

>The success of these patients in using others for attachment purposes has been so limited and their experience of positive internal objects so meager that they live in a near-constant state of anticipated abandonment.
Page 52

>Terri’s capacity to contain unpleasant affect was so limited that she was consistently reactive, constantly acting out her feelings. She could not “sit with them” long enough to reflect on them and learn to understand them better. She seemed to be utterly incapable of regulating affect on her own, so she repeatedly turned to the men in her life to do it for her. This only perpetuated her failure to develop reliable means of managing affect for herself, a failure of which she was unaware because no one had ever modeled self-management for her or, more important, provided a consistently soothing experience that she could internalize and use on her own behalf. This is the task of and an opportunity for the therapist.
Page 54

>Reality perception is skewed further by the borderline individual’s extensive dependence on projection and fantasy that encourage reactive functioning over reflective functioning.
Page 55

>Finally, the inability to reflect makes it hard for borderline patients to recognize and identify their own affects, in a pattern akin to alexithymia, a condition in which feelings cannot be put into words.
Page 55

>To summarize, in our attachment–object relations model, the presence of the following vulnerabilities suggests a borderline personality disorder:
1. Insecure attachment
2. Separation sensitivity
3. Abandonment depression
4. Maladaptive defenses
5. Triad of disorders of the self
6. Split object relations units
7. False defensive self
8. Impaired self-capacities
Page 56

>Activation of the rewarding unit occurred when an idealized person in her life resonated with Terri’s projection of the loving object representation.
Page 57

>Rejection or emotional withdrawal by a significant person would invariably stimulate the despair and rageful acting out of her negative self- representation and her projection of the rejecting object that she under- stood to be the cause of her wretched feelings.

>To summarize, the borderline personality disorder represents an insecure attachment style derived from unmodulated attachment experiences without opportunity to restore disruptions
Page 57

>without consistent alternation of disruption and repair, the experiences of attachment and disrupted attachment have no chance to become integrated.
Page 57

>Because a person with a borderline personality disorder has become trapped in a false defensive self, the task of psychotherapy is to provide an experience that will allow for the emergence and practice of the real self.
Page 58

>This is reminiscent of Rogers (1957), who proposed years ago that conditions provided by the therapist, such as congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathy, are both “necessary and sufficient” (p. 95) to effect change in therapy. Our attachment–object relations model of psychotherapy shares the belief that relational factors are essential to change in psychotherapy.
Page 59

>Originally driven by adaptive needs, these rigidly maintained behavioral propensities remain resistant to reexamination and reflection, even when they have become self-defeating over time.
Page 59

>Over and over, I’ve come in here whining and complaining, or crying, or mad. And I appreciate so much your listening to me without becoming irritated or impatient. That wasn’t even a possibility growing up in my family. They were always either annoyed or critical.
Page 59

>Constrained by the limited relational possibilities of their childhoods, these people are destined to continuously reenact the chaos, confusion, frustration, disappointment, pain, and emotional impoverishment of the past. Until a relationship supportive of the real self and secure attachment can be consistently experienced and internalized, their implicit learning blinds them to other options and possibilities. Their efforts to emotionally survive by establishing interpersonal connections in the only ways that they know are almost heroic
Page 60

>I honor and respect your real self, which I know to exist, although hidden, disguised, or even disavowed, beneath the painful strategies that evolved to ensure your survival. I know that you once learned to suppress this real self, lest you be subject to the dangers and agonies of abandonment, but what enabled you to survive in the past may no longer be necessary. So I will watch and wait and wonder about who you are. And, I hope, through my attention to that elusive self of yours, you will begin to let yourself experience it, too, finding yourself reflected in my eyes.
Page 60

>Affective attunement is needed for the development of secure attachment bonds, reliable affect regulation, and the consolidation of a coherent self. And the borderline patient needs a consistent experience of this kind in the relationship with the psychotherapist.
Page 61

>In Siegel’s words (1999), a therapist and a patient enter into a resonance of states of mind, which al- lows for the creation of a co-regulating dyadic system. This system is able to emerge in increasingly complex dyadic states by means of the attunement between the two individuals. The patient’s subtle nonverbal expressions of her state of mind are perceived by the therapist and responded to with a shift in the therapist’s own state, not just with words. In this way, there is a direct resonance between the primary emotional, psychobiological state of the patient and that of the therapist. These nonverbal expressions are mediated by the right hemisphere of one person and then perceived by the right hemisphere of the other. In this way, the essential nonverbal aspect of psychotherapy, and perhaps all emotional relationships, can be conceived as a right-hemisphere- to-right-hemisphere resonance between two individuals.
Page 61

>"This compliance on the part of the infant,” Winnicott (1965) says, “is the earliest stage of the False Self, and belongs to the mother’s inability to sense her infant’s needs”.

>It is the mother’s support of the child’s solitary activity that encourages and allows for real-self experience. By the mother’s relaxation with the child’s independent play, she is saying, “It’s okay for you to have a separate experience from me and to enjoy exploring.” In a similar way, the therapist’s ease with silence communicates to the patient, “It’s okay for you to have your own separate thoughts in the room—I’ll wait.” It is this attitude of patience that provides a safe environment for the silent, spontaneous, separate self to emerge.
Page 65

>As discussed in the previous chapter, people with borderline character pathology characteristically display an implicit expectation that a connection will not be restored after a rupture.
Page 66

>repeated disruptions of the attuned relationship, followed by repair, are essential to optimal development (Schore, 1994; Settlage, Bemesderfer, Rosenthal, Afterman, and Speilman, 1991; Siegel, 2001; Tronick, 1989).
Page 66

>As Holmes says,
alliance rupture and repair are as much a part of the work of psychotherapy as are key changes and harmonic tension and its resolution in music. Only in the context of an object found, lost and refound can a patient begin to develop autonomy—a sense of self to which he can turn in times of stress. (p. 33)

> Focusing on neurobiology, Schore (1994) states, Dyadic transactions of interactive repair that reduce negative affect, especially after critical moments of shame-induced ruptures of the positive affect bonds of the therapeutic alliance, act as catalytic regulatory mechanisms that facilitate the development of a structural system that can homeostatically maintain positive and recover from negative affective states. (p. 464)
Page 66

>"re-experiencing pathogenic affect and unbearable states in itself is not therapeutic. It is the experience of not being alone in the process of re-experiencing the affects that creates healing."
Page 68

>The successful resolution of an alliance rupture can be a powerful means of disconfirming the client’s dysfunctional interpersonal schema. While failure to adequately resolve an alliance rupture is likely to lead to poor outcome in psychotherapy, the successful resolution of an alliance rupture can be one of the more potent means of inducing change. (p. 156)
Page 69

>The therapist must be a real object or person, not in the sense of sharing his personal life but rather by manifesting an emotionally warm interest in the patient’s problems, sympathizing with his real life defeats and congratulating him on his triumphs, and being empathic about the fact that coping and adaptation are vital to emotional survival. (Masterson, 1985, p. 55)
Page 69

>There may be no more than a quick, nonverbal, almost imperceptible startle, a pregnant pause, or an instant of eye contact. Still, it is precisely at such times that the real relationship is experienced most intensely. And when these moments can eventually be brought to the attention of the patient, a time of co-reflection can ensue.
Page 70

>Most of these patients have never experienced someone else caring about their processes and how it feels to them; to the contrary, their implicit relational procedures have usually driven them to monitor other people’s processes at the expense of their own. This attention from the therapist, this attunement to the slight movements of affect beneath their awareness, invites them to become more cognizant of their real selves in the presence of a benign and interested other. This primes the pump for the real relationship that will, over time, be internalized as a new and more adaptive relational procedure.
Page 70

> The relationship with the therapist is increasingly trusted as an opportunity to be one’s self in an authentic, spontaneous, and self- supporting way—in time, it will be internalized as a new, healthier object relations unit, a more self-supportive internal working model of relationships.

>As this new relationship template is internalized by the borderline patient, the potency of the earlier pathological attachments and related object relations units is further diluted (Blatt, 1992; Schore, 1994; Watt, 1986). In Masterson’s words (1985), “the patient internalizes the therapist as a new, positive object representation along with his positive, supportive attitude to the patient’s individuation and self-representation of being adequate, based on self-assertive efforts at adaptation” (p. 61). Or, in attachment theory terms, “the working model of the therapeutic relation- ship eventually exerts dominance over hurtful experiences and models of the past, countering the patient’s image of himself as unlovable and unworthy of secure affectional ties” (Sable, 2000, p. 333).

>Because this relational practice with the therapist is experienced as being both surprising and satisfying, it fuels the desire for more real-self relating outside of the therapy relationship. So with a budding new appreciation for real-self attachment experiences, the patient is likely to seek to establish and enjoy more meaningful relationships in everyday life.
Page 71

>even sensitive, accurate, and consistent attunement to the patient and repeated experiences of the disruption–repair process, are likely not to be enough in the treatment of personality- disordered patients, if offered in the absence of vigilant attention to structural factors and intervention strategies.
Page 73

>They may look to the therapist not only to initiate and structure sessions, for example, but also to provide direction, advice, affirmation, and encouragement and take responsibility for the regulation of the patient’s feelings and behavior.
Page 74

>she was acting out her helplessness and demonstrating her tendency to focus on the other instead of herself, a common characteristic of borderline personality disorder.
Page 76

>Emotionally laden material may be withheld until the last minutes of the hour, with the expectation that the therapist will extend the session. Crises may stimulate requests for after-hours telephone sessions. Gifts may be offered, or hugs requested. The therapeutic frame helps the therapist resist such pressures.
Page 77

>Masterson (1992) has said that for people with borderline personality disorders, “nothing is ever so bad that it can’t get worse.”
Page 78

>I wonder—and, of course, I may well be wrong—but I wonder if, when you share your experience in here, you become afraid of the closeness. So you withdraw in order to feel more safe, but then you feel isolated, and that’s scary too. It’s like you aren’t really comfortable either way—it’s either too close or too distant.
Page 85

>Unfortunately, in this session, Mary is not yet beginning to see who I am, a therapist who is there to provide support for her to listen to herself, someone in this world who is really interested in her. This is a reality that she has never known. Instead, she is imprisoned in the projection that I am critical and withdrawing, unless she complies with what she thinks I expect of her.
Page 94

>The borderline patient has never had a relationship that consistently communicated,

> You don’t have to fear reality or responsibility. I believe that you can deal with it. You can feel and think and talk about your feelings and thoughts and discover what they mean. When you don’t, you deprive yourself of the chance to improve your lot and experience your competence.
Page 95

>Attunement is the resonating search for the nascent real self that we believe is there.
Page 97

>They believe that you, the therapist, want them to be and act as if they were helpless and that you want to be the one with all the answers. They believe that they are helpless. They do not know how to think for themselves about their feelings and thoughts. And they are not likely to discover otherwise until the therapist first communicates to them the strong expectation that they can learn to do it and then waits and watches patiently while they do so. Sometimes, the only hope that the patients have is the therapist’s confidence in them.
Page 100

>It is only in the context of a more secure attachment relationship with the therapist that secure separation becomes a possibility. It is within a secure-enough attachment that repetitive confrontations, faithful to a commitment to the patient’s real self, are effective. Incrementally, rupture by rupture, negotiation by negotiation, moment by moment, a model of disruption–despair morphs into one of disruption–repair, and a capacity for tolerance of separation and autonomy grows.
Page 102

>We may, in fact, become the patient’s first chance to discover his or her real self. But first or last, through an earned secure attachment and an earned secure separation, it is at least the chance that the patient needs in order to be real.
Page 103

>In both scenarios-ego repair treatment and an intensice psycholytic approach—these broad goals can be broken down into specific ones. Klein (1989d), in his formulation of a shorter-term approach to the treat- ment of the borderline personality disorder, identified three: containment, learning, and adaptation.
Page 105

>In fact, there is evidence that later experiences, including psychotherapy, can result in an “earned secure attachment” (Pearson, Cohn, Cowan, and Cowan, 1994; Phelps, Belsky, and Crnic, 1998). An early-formed insecure attachment style can be replaced by a new internal working model based on a secure attachment, presumably as a function of a later, more adequate experience.
Page 108

>In her view, it is not “knowing that” or “showing that” that is important in psychotherapy but the therapist’s nonverbal “knowing how” and “showing how.” It is the relationship with the therapist, not technique or information for the patient, that is decisive for change in therapy.
Page 108

>Holmes (2001) emphasizes the role of the relationship in the psychotherapy process from an attachment theory perspective but states that “within the context of a secure base, the therapist’s task is to challenge habitual assumptions and relationship patterns and create sufficient turbulence for new structures to emerge. Interpretation, confrontation and clarification are all technical means to achieve this end”.
Page 108

>When the patient expresses anger and criticism toward the therapist, it is with the largely unconscious hope that the therapist will resume a caretaking and enabling stance in the treatment to feel less guilty or clinically inept
Page 113

>As we have noted, the borderline patient typically enters treatment projecting the rewarding object—that is, looking to the therapist with the implicit hope that emotional supplies will be forthcoming in return for helplessness, incompetence, and regression.
Page 117

>She hesitantly agreed that most of her relationships were based on the quality and quantity of caretaking that she could extract from them. (p. 259).
Page 119

>We all would probably like to witness our patients doing their work in therapy so that we can sit back and silently applaud their real-self expression. But getting from here to there is a long, winding road with circuitous detours and periodic dead ends. Throughout therapy, it is easy to be de- toured by getting caught up in the chaotic and often intriguing stories and ways of relating that these people bring to us. But the therapist’s foremost attention must be given to the process of relating, a process that is invisible to the patient. We must watch for these relational procedures, which are living them, imprisoning them in self-destructive lives. We must see these habits that have brought them to the very therapeutic hours in which we sit with them.
Page 121

>It is process, not content, that we look for. Of course, we listen to understand the content of what they offer us, but it is their process, with the added dimension of our presence, that we must focus on. Process, process, process. We watch for which side of the split relational strategy they bring to us in therapy. We watch for any real-self experience or real- self activation that stimulates glimpses of the abandonment depression. Then we look for the defense or attachment procedure that follows. Are they looking for a rewarding object, or are they suddenly splitting to react to a withdrawing object (their triad)? We watch for our reactions (we discuss this point further in chapter 10). We attend to therapeutic neutrality and watch their process, what they are doing. We offer our best confrontations. Then we wait to see if they seem to be reflecting on them, metabolizing them, and continuing with self-reflection or if they shift back into defense. And then we wait and we watch again. We watch and give our eyes to the patients through compassionate confrontation. It is not possible for them to watch themselves, unless we watch first. Then we communicate to them what we see, within a relationship where trust is foundational. This is the prime mover of psychotherapy. (This may be the most important paragraph in the book.)
Page 122

>When in the context of empathic attunement the therapist watches for process and brings it to the patient’s awareness over and over, the patient begins to see and wonder about his or her own habits. It is then, with seeing and recognizing one’s own triad, that one can choose to be oneself—because psychotherapy offers, incrementally, another chance to be real.
Page 122

>Terri’s circumstances "forced" her into therapy, but there was no sense of duress about it: She knew that she needed help, and she was easger for it. In fact, it soon became apparent that the few telephone calls that she had made to me during her years away had confirmed her projection of me as someone who was willing, if not actively wanting, to rescue her and relieve her of responsibility for her problems.
Page 125

>she also became aware of her underlying anxiety about displeasing me and, ultimately, her fear of being abandoned by me.
Page 126

>This relationally wired her to focus on others first and follow their lead because the other half of Susan’s relational experience, the withdrawing model, expected that any self-expressive urges would be met with punishment. Her parents, especially her father, were experienced as critical, unpredictably explosive people, as if in a war zone, intolerant of any expressions of spontaneity, emotional separation, or autonomous activity. Her consequent terror was so intense—like being in a foxhole on a battlefield—that she numbed out her feelings and any experience of her real self. So unaccustomed was Susan to authentic ways of being that she did not even allow herself to experience her fear, hurt, and anger. In fact, she disavowed these feelings.

>The wiring in your brain is there, but that is what we are about. We, in this relationship, over time, are rewiring your brain.
Page 148

>the patient’s defenses may not be adequate to manage, in an adaptive way, the abandonment depression, separation anxiety, and trauma that inevitably emerge in psychotherapy.
Page 162

>If splitting, projection, projective identification, and homicidal or suicidal impulses dominate the clinical picture, the patient may not be able to tolerate the emergence of the abandonment depression without counter therapeutic regression.
Page 163

>Many borderline- disordered patients possess an uncanny psychic radar that identifies and targets the therapist’s developmental residues and manipulates them to enforce collaboration with the projections of the rewarding or withdrawing units
Page 164

>Preoccupations with a particular patient or dreams about her or him signify a boundary disturbance in the relationship, an over involvement.
Page 167

>When we start to feel that the practice of psychotherapy is all there is to life, we are in trouble.
Page 168

>In the experience of being seen, known, and validated by a more mature other, somehow—spontaneously, mysteriously—the self emerges.
Page 170

>When these relational conditions are absent, when this other person is not reliably available or is available only on condition of compliance and dependency, the conditions of attachment implicitly demand the development of a false defensive self to maintain interpersonal connections and ward off the abandonment depression.
Page 170

>In lieu of a real-self attachment, the false self represents a creative, uncanny gift—a testament to the indomitable human hunger for attachment and an essential fear of life without it.
Page 170

>Relationships are unsatisfying; jobs can’t be held; there is no joy—life isn’t working. This is when people come to us for help.
Page 170

>That is, the psychotherapy of borderline personality disorder requires specific technical and structural parameters but in the context of a real relationship between the therapist and the patient.
Page 170

>Repeated experiences of the disruption–repair cycle en- able the internalization of a model of relational repair, an antidote to the model of abandonment fears and relational despair. Finally, the real-self- to-real-self relationship between therapist and patient procedures a new, healthier object relations unit, a new working model of relationships to be internalized, and affords a foretaste of more satisfying relational experiences ahead.
