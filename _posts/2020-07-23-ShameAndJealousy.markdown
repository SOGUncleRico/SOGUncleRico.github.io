> Shame and jealousy are hidden turmoils that pervade human life, exerting their secret terror and control from within. Neither is easily acknowledged. Both are "shame-full". In
> the gaps and clumsy steps in human intercourse, in the misunder­ standings, the misperceptions, and misjudgements, in the blank mocking eyes where empathy should be, in the look of disgust where a smile was anticipated, i n the loneliness and disappointment of inarticulate desire that cannot be communicated because the words cannot be found, in the terrible hopeless absence when human connection fails, and in the empty yet rage-filled desolation of abuse—there in these holes and missing bits lies shame. Shame is where we fail. And the most fundamental failure is the failure to connect with other human beings—originally the mother. Jealousy lies in our perception that there is an other (originally the Oedipal other, or a sibling) who might succeed in connecting where we have failed.

> During periods of loving intimacy with Natalie, Pedro would experience a joyful sense of being special to her, of being her "chosen one" and he would bask in the warmth of her affection. Then each time one of her infidelities became apparent, Pedro would feel violently ejected from his place of intimacy with her— thrown into a profoundly painful place of exclusion and shame— and would feel that he was the stranger, looking on with anguished envy at the union of his beloved with an other

> In the beginning, mother and baby are normally exquisitely attuned to one another, engaging in highly synchronized "conversations" of voice and facial expression.

> mother and baby are processing each other's emotional messages far faster than conscious awareness
Page 23

> If the baby smiles and the mother smiles back, the baby feels recognized and responded to. The baby finds itself in the warmth of the mother's smile,2 Her smile means that he or she has the capacity to evoke a response—to evoke her love. This is the beginning of the baby's sense of efficacy, which I suggest is based upon the capacity to evoke an emotional response in the other (Broucek, 1979; Mollon, 1993). If there is no response—a blank face—or a response that contains no comprehension of the baby's state, then he or she feels fundamentally impotent, ineffectual, having no emotional significance.
Page 24

> It is the same in adult life too. A person smiles at us—a smile of genuine affection and friendship—and we feel warmed by the energy of their love. We feel recognized and valued. If we fail to elicit a smile when we anticipate or hope for one, then we feel rejected, diminished, and aware of a drop in our emotional temperature. Our self-esteem momentarily falls. Whereas in response to the smile, we feel confident about moving forward, expecting acceptance, with the absence of the smile, or the blank face, we feel uncertain, hesitant—and in the grip of a background state of shame. Whilst we might try to ignore such subtleties of experience as we press on with the day to day tasks of life, nevertheless they are there making their mark on our emotions and behaviour.
Page 24

> For the baby who experiences the mother's face as responsive not to the baby, but as reflecting only her own moods and preoccupations, the consequences can be serious. Winnicott described how some babies will learn to, "study the maternal visage in an attempt to predict the mother's mood, just exactly as we all study the weather", and will draw emotional conclusions from the observations:
 The baby quickly learns to make a forecast: "Just now it is safe to forget the mother's mood and to be spontaneous, but any minute the mother's face will become fixed or her mood will dominate and my own personal needs must then be withdrawn otherwise my central self will suffer insult," [Winnicott, 1967] Seidler (2000) notes that situations of shame are always "envisaged", i.e. involve exposure to the gaze of others.
Page 25

> Since our sense of self is formed in the context of relationship with others, involving the capacity to envisage oneself in the eyes of the other (G. H. Mead, 1934), it follows that shame is inherent in the formation of the self. According to Winnicott's formula, the baby's experience of self rests upon the principle "I am seen, therefore I exist." However, the gaze of the other (primarily mother) will not always be approving and loving; as well as at times not seeing the child's subjectivity, her look may be disapproving and hostile generating rather global feelings in the small child of being "bad". The problem is that the gaze of the other, even if dysphoria- inducing, is necessary for the development of the self. Seidler (2000) comments as follows:
  If the gaze of the other is experienced not only as judgemental but as censorious, and thus as ascribing to the self bad characteristics ... the result will be an identification of the self as "bad". The urge to eliminate an other experienced as a disruptive force will then recursively weaken the self or the subject because it needs the ga2e of the other as a condition of its existence, [p. 179]
Page 26

> The child's encounter with sexuality, his or her own and that of the parents, is inherently disturbing. Sexuality is traumatic,as Bollas (2000) argues in his discussion of hysteria: sexuality destroys the innocence of a self and mother, transforming the prelapsarian Utopia of "baba" and "mama" into the world of self and sex object, contaminating the simplicity of dependence with desire ... Sexuality-in-itself, intensified ... by the child's auto-erotic stimulations, is the agency of trauma, all by its fearsome self. [Bollas, 2000, p. 14]
Page 28

> Without the Oedipal ejection from the dyadic entanglement with the mother, and the projection into the triadic space, the child may be unable to proceed along the line of separation-individuation. He or she continues to try to be the child the mother wants—the mother's phallus—rather than following his or her own developmental initiatives. This can be a fulfilment of the mother's grandiosity, where her child's function is to cast her in a favourable light. What may appear as an air of superiority i n some patients w i t h significant degrees of false self development may actually be this kind of expression of the mother's narcissism. In such a person, their own desires and initiatives, and natural exhibitionism, may be associated with much shame and anxiety, and as a result may be repressed—emerging only against great resistance in the process of analysis or psychotherapy. These difficulties are described in detail in Kohut (1971).
Page 31

> The shame associated with emergence from a false self position is to do with the expectation that the more authentic feelings and aspirations (the "true self") will not be recognized, understood or accepted. It is akin to emerging from behind a mask, or taking off a costume, or exposing oneself as having been a fraud or impostor. The fear is that this will be an embarrassing shock to the other. In general, situations of embarrassment always involve some kind of disruption of the expectations one person has of another. It follows, then, that for the person who has developed an extensive false self the more authentic aspects of self will be felt as an embarrassment. There will tend to be a continual monitoring of the presentation of "self", so as to fit in with the expectations and desires of the other. This is the basis of embarrassed self-consciousness. Shame and embarrassment arise in the jarring cracks between the expectation of the other and the actual feelings and behaviour of the self.
Page 31

> The person with an extensive false self development has become trapped in an image—the image of the child the mother wanted him or her to be. Instead of having felt recognized and accepted as himself, his own potential being nurtured, the child has become inhabited by the mother's fantasy. Whilst to some extent all human identities are false, insofar as we have to construct a "self" on the basis of the roles and images available in the pre-existing culture into which we are born, this process becomes more tilted in the direction of pathology when the mother's narcissism takes precedence over her concern to recognize and nurture her particular child. The more authentic self then becomes a potential embarrass­ ment and a source of anxiety, along the lines of, "What if my mother/the world in general discovers that I am not what they assume I am—I will be greeted with horrified shock and rejection— this possibility is so terrible that I must make absolutely sure that my real self does not emerge—I must conceal it from myself".
Page 31

> A twelve-year-old boy in Britain in the 1960s, when short trousers were the norm for younger schoolboys, became increasingly embarrassed because he was the only one left in his class who had not graduated to long trousers. His mother expressed reluctance to buy him long trousers on the grounds that she did not like to see children looking too grown-up. The message from this, and other aspects of his mother's behaviour, was that she wanted her son to remain a child, without regard for his own experience, desire, and developmental need. About four-years later, the young man had managed to acquire long trousers, but he became extremely worried and embarrassed because he was increasingly needing to shave but did not have a razor or other equipment. He did not know how to bring this to his parents' attention, fearing again that his developing adult body would be a shocking disruption of his mother's image of him as a child. On the other hand he was afraid that there would come a point when the whiskers on his face would suddenly evoke an expression of horrified surprise from his mother. He did not feel he could confide in his father, who was a rather passive and distant figure, frequently the butt of his mother's criticism and scorn. In such a situation, pervaded by potential embarrassment, the embarrassment that is feared is the embarrass­ ment of the other when their expectation is disrupted.
Page 32

> Shame emerges at moments of our deepest psychological vulnerability. Exposure to the risk of shame is inherent in one person's offer of intimacy with an other—and is a measure of the value placed upon that other. Thus the adolescent boy must balance his fear of shame, and the risk of humiliation and rejection, against the strength of his desire when he considers approaching a girl, stuttering and blushing, as he awkwardly asks her out. This is true also of the child who is willing to communicate his or her feelings and needs to the mother or father. Such willingness is not to be taken for granted. Repeated rejection, scorn or gross empathic failure, may lead to an entrenched reluctance to communicate emotional need and a persisting avoidance of intimacy in later life. Too much shame results in an unconscious decision not to risk further exposure. The "true self" goes into hiding.
Page 33

> Shame arises both from violation of the self, and from exposure of the self when this is not met with the expected or hoped for empathy.
Page 34

> Shame manifests itself when a subject in quest of attunement encounters something-someone "strange", causing it to recoil back onto itself. [Seidler, 2000, p. 320]
Page 34

> The young child's wishes for attunement with the mother, the enjoyment of basking in mutual love and the mirroring gaze and smile—Kohut's "gleam in the mother's eye"—is disrupted by sexuality (as well as other components of mental life that propel the child towards separation-individuation). The child's sexual desire, and his or her recognition of that of the parents, brings a disturbing and "strange" element into the infantile world. The mother is recognized as having a relationship with the father, from which the child is excluded. It is a relationship that the child does not understand, however much he or she may try to conceptualize this in terms of his own desires and phantasies. In

> Shame involves a hole—a hole where our connection to others should be. In shame we fall out of the dance, the choreography of the human theatre. And in the deepest depths of shame we fall into a limbo where there are no words but only silence. In this no-place there are no eyes to see us, for the others have averted their gaze—no-one wishes to see the dread that has no name.
Page 37


> Shame is a response to failure and to ensuing feelings of inadequacy—especially a failure when success was expected. Instances always involve a sense of failure in the eyes of others
Page 40

> The spectrum of shame-evoking failure is very wide indeed: e.g. failure to achieve academically or in a career; failure to possess a desirable accent, body, clothes, or social skills; failure to be accepted by others and be included as part of a social group; failure to understand information; failure to perceive and respond appropriately to the social requirements of a situation accurately; failure to have acquired symbols of status and social and material success; failure to retain control over display of emotion; failure to control one's body. However, the most fundamental failure, I suggest, is that of not being able to evoke an empathic response in the other.
Page 40

> However, shame is a peculiarly global state, castingits shadow over the whole sense of self, whilst guilt tends to have a more discrete reference to particular actions (Lewis, 1971; Lynd, 1958). As Thrane (1979) puts it,in guilt we say "How can I have done that!"; in shame we say "How can I have done that!".

> Interpretations, if they were not framed as an empathic grasp of her experience, but instead referred to a psychodynamic defence or process, would be experienced by her as controlling and fragmenting;at such moments she would feel objectified, shamed, and in a state of painful self-consciousness.
Page 45

> Many patients experience some degree of self-consciousness when feeling that their communications to the therapist are not immediately understood. It is as if at those times the experience is of being the object of an other's uncomprehending gaze; there is no sense of affirmation of common humanity—or of Kohut's (1984) sense of twinship, where it is felt that "here is an other who is like myself".

> of the presence of an unempathic internal object. This unempathic figure is then projected onto the therapist, leading the patient to expect a lack of understanding and responsiveness. The patient fears that he or she is gazed upon by an other who looks not with empathy butwith incomprehension.

Page 46

> For the child, too much looking or too little looking are both damaging to the delicately emerging sense of self. The natural exhibitionism of the child looks for the"gleam in the mother's eye" (Kohut, 1971), but fears the look that seems to invade and control.
Page 46

> Gradually, and against strong resistances (motivated by deep shame, fear of overstimulation, fear of traumatic disappointment), the narcissistic transference began to centre around his need to have his body-mind-self confirmed by the analyst's admiring acceptance, [p. 182]
Page 50

> Once the child hasmade this devil's pact of identifying with the image that mother loves, sacrificing his or her true self in the service of retaining her love, the hidden corrosive inner development is then set on its inevitable course. With the possibility of authentic development thus sabotaged, the person will feel that the true inner self is increasingly unlovable and must remain hidden.
Page 51

> A shame prone patient would frequently speak of his wish to be "pure intellect", to be without a body with its needs, its lusts, and its imperfections.
Page 53

> His body was a source of great shame. It represented limitations and biological need—a continual affront to narcissistic aspirations for freedom, perfection, and self­ sufficiency. Andre Green, in a discussion of "moral narcissism" writes:
	In the case of the moral narcissist, hell is not other people— narcissism has eliminated them—but rather the body. The body is an Other, resurrected in spite of numerous attempts to wipe out its traces. The body is a limitation, a servitude, a termination ... their body is their absolute master—their shame. [1982]
Page 53

> When I was first training in psychoanalytic therapy I was taught that it was very important to ask a patient about masturbation fantasies during the initial assessment because these were considered to provide clues to crucial conflicts and anxieties. I have always tended to feel reluctant to make such enquiries, especially in an initial meeting. Although it does seem that masturbation fantasies can reveal core desires and anxieties relating to essential aspects of the self, to ask about these directly (unless done with the utmost tact) can be experienced as violating and in disregard of the patient's natural shame. This is especially the case insofar as sexual fantasies can often be under­ stood as sexualized narratives about injuries and vulnerabilities in the sense of self—the core self that must not be violated, as Winnicott (1960), Khan (1972), Stoller (1976) and Kohut (1971,1977) amongst others have emphasized.
Page 55





> The sexual stimulation of one's own body can be experienced as a private addiction, associated with feelings of weakness and thus shame. Its prominence in a person's life may be felt to be an indication of his or her inadequacy and inability to form a satisfying sexual relationship with another person. An activity of giving pleasure to oneself, which inherently is non-social and private inevitably must be associated with shame if it is exposed to others. Masturbation is the only pleasurable activity that, inherent in its nature, is not for sharing with others.

> even more undesirable and unlovable. Shame, rage, self-hatred, falling self­ esteem, depression, and further shame—this tangle of "breakdown products" of narcissistic injury (Kohut, 1977)—spiral relentlessly in an accelerating negative feedback, culminating, in the case of vulnerable individuals, in suicide or serious self-harm

Page 57





> Such individuals know that their deteriorating mental state makes them increasingly unattractive and undesirable and this adds to their sense of shame. Shame begets shame—and the only antidote to shame is the empathic and affectionate response of another person. Those who are fortunate enough to have experienced sufficient love and empathy in childhood are able to draw upon these internalized experiences and find their own self-directed empathy. For those
> who have not, shame may expand without limit.

Page 57

> To some extent the active destructiveness directed towards the self displayed by certain depressive patients can be understood as an attempt to avoid feelings of helplessness and shame in response to rejection. Guntrip (1968) made a similar point when he argued that sado-masochistic internal object relations function as a defence against intolerable feelings of weakness and helplessness. I n such a way, depression can be seen sometimes as an attempt to protect the sense of self (Mollon & Parry, 1984). For example, one chronically depressed patient had never managed to separate from her mother, with whom she maintained a hostile masochistic dependence. She described how all her life she had felt she had to be something for other people, whether they be mother, friends, or the therapist in the transference; she felt she always had to slot into the "vision" that her mother had for her. This became quite explicit in the transference where she felt that to become dependent on the therapist meant that she would be taken over and would lose all her autonomy. She made several plans for suicide, which she saw as one way in which she could escape from the grip of the other and affirm her own self even if this meant her death. In this way she could assert that her life belonged to her and was therefore hers to end. Each time she made these plans she threw out all her personal possessions and letters and anything that had any emotional meaning for her. Eventually she became able to say why she did this. It was, she said, in order to prevent others prying into her personal belongings after she was dead. Thus she wished to avoid the sense of shame associated with violation of her core self, even after death. She was engaged in a lifelong struggle to emerge from the shame-ridden state of being an object for the other, and to find and protect the autonomy and integrity of her self—even at the expense of ending the life of her body.
Page 58

> I have often found that when a patient becomes enraged in psychotherapy or analysis, it is because he or she feels that the analyst is not accurately (empathically) grasping their experience; instead, the analyst is perceived as persisting in a point of view of their own. It becomes a battle of perspectives. Similarly, I may find myself experiencing some degree of "rage" towards a patient if I feel that he or she is not listening to what I am actually saying but is persisting in misperceiving and mishearing my meaning according to their own assumptions. The process is one I have described as "identity imposition", an insistence on viewing a person in a particular way, despite contrary evidence (Mollon, 2001a). It can be a pervasive part of some people's childhood experience, sowing the seeds of chronic narcissistic rage—and, of course, they will then be inclined to want to turn the tables and subject others (including the analyst or therapist) to the same experience.
Page 61

> Facial mirroring between infant and mother is an important vehicle of transmission of affect, having a direct effect on the developing child's brain. The "still face" experiments indicate that an absence of the expected facial mirroring can be extremely disturbing to the infant, provoking primitive shame responses. Shame is, in other ways too, intimately associated w i t h looking and being looked at. A distinction can be drawn between the look of empathy, which affirms the looked-at person as subject, and the look which objectifies and creates shame.
Page 64







> The mother of such a child may have been experienced as extremely controlling, invasive, and lacking in empathy. This would be associated with pervasive shame, both because the child's need to be understood empathically would be continually thwarted, and because the core self would be felt to be in danger of violation. As a result, the child would come to feel that attachment relationships are fundamentally threatening to the core self. In later life, the formation of attachment, involving potential vulnerability, would give rise to anxiety. The stronger the attachment, the greater the anxiety.




> In women, this pattern may be associated with promiscuity, combined with sexual inhibition within the main attachment relationship. This is because sex within an attachment relationship is experienced as violation, modelled on the original perception of the mother as invasive and controlling. Sex w i t h the attachment partner is felt to be abusive and an imposition. Any hint of pressure or expectation of compliance with the partner's desire would evoke intense resistance to sexual activity. The woman may be able to express her sexuality and achieve gratificationonly with a partner to w h o m she is not attached, or by masturbation. By these means, her sense of agency and autonomy in relation to her sexuality is preserved. This protection is of considerable importance since sexuality—resting on a knife-edge between shame and p r i d e — inherently connotes privacy and intimacy with the core self.
Page 68

Psychic murder syndrome
> This is a complex mental organization and process in which emotional experience and relationships are continually "mur­ dered"—an inner destruction which repeats an earlier one recurrently experienced with the care-giver. An original trauma is continually re-enacted, both internally and in relation to emotional partners. The "partner" (whether spouse/lover or therapist) is inevitably subjected to an experience of the original trauma (usually without being able to make much sense of what is happening). The purpose of this mental organization is, paradoxically, to protect against the danger of further violation of the core of the self and its true potential.
Page 71

> The pattern originates in an early environment that is experienced by the child as fundamentally hostile to his or her true self. The child's own initiatives and emotional communications are systematically rebuffed, mocked, ignored or actively punished. Instead are substituted the mother's desires to have a particular kind of child. The child registers this as a terrifying psychic murder (although such early perceptions cannot be elaborated in language). Profound distrust is established at the core of the child's being.
Page 71

> A core of "paranoid" confusion develops, based on the child's perception that the one who is needed and is the source of comfort and nourishment is also the source of psychic murder. This state of confusion may be utterly intolerable. The child may split these perceptions, at times viewing the mother as loving, whilst at other times switching into the view of her as malevolent (this splitting is based upon the intolerable perception of actual qualities of the mother rather than the child's difficultyin integratinghis/her own conflictingfeelings of love and hate, as outlined in Kleinian theory).
Page 72

> Despite the continual inner psychic murder, there may persist a hope of a relationship in which the "true self" can be expressed and recognized. At a deep level, this desire will be very powerful. If a suitable potential partner is found, there may be an attempt to relate on a deeper level of intimacy.
Page 73

> Some intimacy and trust may be established, but at a certain point the "anti-trust" enforcement will kick in, creating a radical disruption of the relationship. There will then ensue vigorous attempts to sever the relationship and drive the partner away, at the same time as some struggles to maintain the relationship. This is a time of intense conflict and turmoil, both internally and in the external relationship.
Page 74

> The experience of the partner (or the therapist if the context is psychotherapy/psychoanalysis) gives some clue to the internal processes of psychic murder. There will be moments, or even prolonged periods, of emotional contact and communication of emotional meaning—but these will be abruptly and unexpect­ edly terminated, creating feelings in the partner of traumatic confusion, disappointment, and betrayal. Attempts to commu­ nicate emotionally will be met with a bewildering blankness (like an utter failure of the communicative aspects of projective identification).
Page 74


> However, I have noticed that often patients who appear very attacking of the analyst's attempted communications will cease to be so when they feel that their experience and anxiety are properly understood. What may fuel attacks which appear full of hatred and envy is a perception that the analyst is convinced of the correctness of his or her view. At such times, the analyst is perceived as serenely secure in a belief in his or her intellectual, emotional and moral truth—and as unreceptive to the patient's communications of anguish. This tends to repeat a childhood perception of the mother as walled off from the child's distress and as self-righteous in her view of herself and of her maternal functions. The "cure" for the patient's (and child's) hostile state of mind is an empathic response from the analyst (or mother) that expresses a recognition and understanding of the distress, including particularly the analyst's (or mother's) contribution to that distress. This indicates howthe distress is closely related to shame, the cure for which is also an empathic response. A further related point is that if a patient is frequently in states of great agitation and confusion, then it is quite to be expected that he or she might feel some envy, alongside gratitude, if the analyst appears always calm, thoughtful, and able to make sense of the patient's turbulent mind. Acknowledging this does not imply that the patient has an unusual level of constitu­ tional envy, but simply recognizes that those who are in a state of anguish and despair may envy those who appear to have peace of mind. This envy can be diminished to the extent that the patient can recognize that the analyst is struggling and, to some extent, suffering with them in the exploration of their anguish.

SHAME AND JEALOUSY





> Jealousy erupts violently, often without warning, brutally trampling on feelings of love and trust. The effect can be traumatizing for both the one who feels it and the one to whom it is directed. Its torment is intense and insistent, accompanied by powerful physiological concomitants, the whole body shaking and pulsating with shock.
Page 92

> Shame and jealousy fuel each other: the perception of a rival contains the idea of one's own inadequacy compared to an other, and hence gives rise to shame and jealousy—which gives rise to further shame and feelings of inadequacy—in turn giving rise to further jealousy—and so on.
Page 92

> It is easy to see that essentially it is compounded of grief, the pain caused by the thought of losing the loved object, and of the narcissistic wound, in so far as this is distinguishable from the other wound; further of feelings of enmity against the successful rival, and of a greater or lesser amount of self-criticism which tries to hold the subject's own ego accountable for his loss. Although we may call it normal, this jealousy is by no means completely rational, that is, derived from the actual situation, proportionate to the real circumstances and under the complete control of the conscious ego; for it is rooted deep in the unconscious, it is a continuation of the earliest stirrings of the child's affective life, and it originates in the Oedipus or brother-and-sister complex of the first sexual period. [Freud, 1922, p. 223]
Page 105

> Nevertheless, the patient's jealousy was at times so persecutory in character that Riviere was convinced that something was being projected, even if it was unclear what.
Page 108

> Fenichel begins with two puzzling features of jealousy. First, he makes the point that jealousy is not necessarily strongest where a previous state of love has been greatest—and that, in fact, those who are most inclined to be jealous may often be those who are incapable of deeper forms of love and who change their love-objects continually.
Page 110

> Regarding the first point, Fenichel argues that those prone to jealousy tend to be "orally fixated" people whose self-esteem is unusually dependent upon receiving love—an external locus of self­ esteem. This need to take in "narcissistic supplies" from the environment is similar to that shown by depressive and other patients with "oral" or "self-regarding" neuroses—as described originally by Rado (1928).
Page 110

> Without the narcissistic supplies from the analyst to "maintain" her, as she put it, she experienced anxiety, depersonalization and feelings of worthlessness. (In the more contemporary terms of Kohutian self-psychology, this would be described as a mirroring transference, in which the analyst is required to function as a "selfobject"—i.e. to function as part of the patient's narcissistic economy.) During the analysis the patient's jealousy increased, taking the form of torturing thoughts about when and where and how he might be seeing the other woman, with compulsive fantasies of their sexual intimacy. Eventually she declared that she could not tolerate having to think of her husband "giving his penis" to another woman. Fenichel concluded that she thought of her husband's

> Envy is the angry feeling that another person possesses and enjoys something desirable—the envious impulse being to take it away or to spoil it. Moreover, envy implies the subject's relation to one person only and goes back to the earliest exclusive relation with the mother. Jealousy is based on envy, but involves a relation to at least two people; it is mainly concerned with love that the subject feels is his due and has been taken away, or is in danger of being taken away, from him by his rival. In the everyday conception of jealousy, a man or a woman feels deprived of the loved person by somebody else. [p. 181]
Page 114

> In jealousy there is a fear of losing that which is loved, whereas in envy the good object is itself attacked. Klein quotes Crabb's English Synonyms: "The envious man sickens at the sight of enjoyment. He is easy only in the misery of others" (Klein, p. 182). She notes that envy is classed amongst the "seven deadly sins", and comments, "I would even suggest that it is unconsciously felt to be the greatest sin of all, because it spoils and harms the good object which is the source of life" (p. 189). Klein argued that jealousy arises out of the original envy towards the feeding breast, and forms part of the early Oedipal situation: "Jealousy is based on the suspicion of and rivalry with the father, who is accused of having taken away the mother's breast and the mother" (p. 196). She adds that disturbances in the early relationship to the mother, because of environmental factors or the strength of envy, complicates the rivalry with the father in the Oedipal situation:
	The development of the Oedipus complex is strongly influenced by the vicissitudes of the first exclusive relation with the mother, and when this relation is disturbed too soon, the rivalry with the father enters prematurely. Phantasies of the penis inside the mother, or inside her breast, turn the father into a hostile intruder. This phantasy is particularly strong when the infant has not had the full enjoyment and happiness that the early relation to the mother can afford him and has not taken in the first good object with some security. Such a failure partly depends on the strength of envy. She describes how the phantasy of the mother's breast or body containing the father's penis, or of the father containing the breast or the mother, form the basis of a common phantasy of the "combined parents". This is particularly provocative of envy because the parents are then felt to be in continuous intercourse and providing each other w i t h never-ending pleasurable sexual gratification. However, when envy is not too excessive, Oedipal jealousy can become a means of modifying it because the hostility then is directed at a rival (the father or siblings) so that one figure is still loved:
		With the boy, a good deal of hate is deflected onto the father who is envied for the possession of the mother; this is the typical Oedipus jealousy. With the girl, the genital desires for the father enable her to find another loved object. Thus jealousy to some extent supersedes envy; the mother becomes the chief rival. The girl desires to take her mother's place and to possess and take care of the babies which the loved father gives to the mother. The identification with the mother in this role makes a wider range of sublimations possible. It is essential also to consider that the working-through of envy by means of jealousy is at the same time a defence against envy. Jealousy is felt to be much more acceptable and gives rise much less to guilt than the primary envy which destroys the first good object, [p. 198]

> Thus Klein describes how jealousy, when based on envy, gives rise to the wish to rob the rival, who originally represents the mother. When this wish to rob is projected, then the jealous person lives in continual fear of being robbed by a rival.

> isthisaswellaswantingtheotherpersonnottohaveit"(p.59). He
> goes on to describe envy as follows:
> In envy one is unhappy that another person possesses something one would like to have for oneself and feels inferior because of not having it. This may be a thing, a person, or both; or it may be a quality such as success, reputation, or happiness. Envy may also include admiration of the envied thing or person, covetousness towards the envied thing, hatred or resentment of the person possessing the envied thing, a wish to harm the envied person, and, perhaps, a wish to rob the person of the envied thing. Crucial to the definition is that the interpersonal configuration is a two-person one in which the other person has possession of that which is envied, [p. 60]
> Regarding jealousy, he comments:
> In jealousy one experiences apprehension, anxiety, suspicion, or mistrust concerning the loss of a highly valued possession, or the diversion to another, a third person, of affection and love. It is often associated with an attitude of vigilant guarding against the threatened loss and an effort to preserve the status quo, to maintain possession. In sexual love this might involve an attempt to exact exclusive devotion from the love object. The possession, or valued "good", in jealousy tends to be a person or the affection of a person rather than an inanimate object or quality, but this is not always so. Rivalry with a third person is typically involved and highlights a crucial aspect of jealousy; it occurs in a three-person situation in which the jealous person fears a third person will intrude upon a two-person relationship and take possession, [p. 61]

Page 119








> Thus Spielman emphasizes the distinction between envy and jealousy primarily in terms of whether it is a two-person or three­ person situation. However, he sees jealousy as the more complex emotion, which contains envy as a component. Jealousy includes a sense of loss or threat of loss, which is not inherent in envy. Also the jealous person may be more inclined towards self-blame for failures (e.g. in losing a lover to a rival). In addition, jealousy, especially in its more pathological forms, may include elements of projection of the person's own disavowed heterosexual, homosexual, and hostile wishes. This projection may also contribute to a paranoid trend in jealous individuals.
Page 119

> Envy, jealousy, and shame are intimately related. Shame reflects our sense of being disconnected, separate, inferior, misunderstood, or excluded—and then envy and jealousy may closely follow.
Page 121

> In a panel discussion of these three emotions, Reisenberg-Malcolm (reported by De Paola, 2001) described a patient who experienced shame whenever the analyst said something about which he had not thought before, reacting like a person stabbed. This painful experience of shame appeared to be triggered by a feeling that an infantile state of oneness with the analyst in the transference had been "cut", so that the patient was then confronted with the reality that the source of the interpretations was the analyst; at such moments he would feel separate and inferior. At other times, the same patient would display envy and jealousy whenever he was confronted with his lack of exclusive ownership of the analyst whom he could potentially experience as a needed and longed-for figure. Jealousy would express his wish for an exclusive relation­ ship, whilst envy would lead him to adopt an aloof and triumphant-contemptuous stance.
Page 121

> In the same panel discussion, Morrison and Lansky pointed to the way in which envy, contempt, and shame are all concerned with comparison of self to other. In envy the other is exalted and hated, whilst in contempt the other is despised and lowered in comparison with an exalted self. If envy is consciously experienced, then it is accompanied by shame, which Morrison and Lansky view as the core emotion in negative self-evaluation. Shame can function as a warning of threats to connection with the other and can initiate attempts to repair or restore the bond; on the other hand, envy and contempt represent attempts to remove oneself from the other's power to threaten rejection or loss. In this way, Morrison and Lansky view envy and contempt as expressions of a shame-derived vision of the "death instinct", Thanatos—a protective withdrawal from needed figures; they contrasted this with a Kleinian view of envy as a form of primary aggression emanating from Thanatos (De Paola, 2001).
Page 121

> Thus shame erupts when a gulf arises between self and other—a disruption of empathy, understanding, acceptance, or attunement— resulting then in an evaluation of self as lacking or inferior in some way. Closely following shame may be envy, as the other is perceived as desired, separate, and unavailable. Jealousy may come into play as more favoured rivals are seen as potentially taking the place of intimacy with the other, from which the self has been ejected. Contempt and devaluation of the other may be a defence against shame, envy, and jealousy.

> His ensuing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder were quite marked—with anxiety, depression, suicidal preoccupa­ tions, sleep disturbance, and intrusive flashback images of the woman's confession of infidelity. In the analysis it was possible to link these reactions to his infantile experience when his mother had become depressed and withdrawn during his second year of life following a stillbirth (an event which he had been told about but could not, of course, remember directly). It seemed likely that this early experience had predisposed him to be very alert to indications of a woman's degree of emotional involvement or withdrawal from him—and to link withdrawal in some way with the idea of a rival for the woman's emotional attention. Thus his perceptions of his friend's withdrawal and infidelity, her sexual fantasies, and her state of mind in relation to him, were probably highly accurate—but disavowed in response to her wish to deny them and his wish to believe her

The case of Celine—a frenzy of shame and jealousy
> Celine, an attractive and highly intelligent woman in her early twenties, sought psychoanalytic help because of her patterns of tormenting anxiety, jealousy, and depression that were recurrent in her relationships with men. She was from a wealthy French background, but had come to Britain to study, in the hope that a new environment would free her from her anguish. In terms of psychiatric diagnosis she would have been described as having a borderline personality disorder—and this was indeed her view of herself, having read some relevant literature.
> From the beginning of the therapy, she displayed pronounced jealousy, as well as overwhelming feelings of shame. She was markedly sexually seductive, openly speaking of her desires to engage the analyst in a sexual relationship—and expressing rage when he declined her offer. She viewed his refusal as a personal rejection, despite his efforts both to maintain and to explain a psychoanalytic stance. Indeed she seemed to view the refusal of a sexual relationship as evidence that the analyst regarded her with contempt and found her disgusting—at such times she appeared infused with feelings of shame and would be tearful. Moreover, she became violently jealous of other patients, w h o m she fantasized were receiving more or better attentionfrom the analyst. If she saw evidence of the existence of other patients she would fly into a rage, accusing the analyst of favouring these rivals. Often she would demand physical contact with the analyst and express anguish when this was refused. Her desperation about her need for bodily engagement was expressed with vivid clarity when she shouted in one session "Do you want me to cut myself or take my clothes off?". Thus her stance towards the analyst in the early weeks and months was characterized mainly by a combination of rage, sexual overtures, and the seeking of physical contact, all pervaded by shame and jealousy.
> Her early associations to these feelings towards the analyst were of memories and family accounts of her mother having often been depressed in the first few years of her life, so that Celine might be left for long periods without stimulation, without being physically touched or held, and in unbearable states of boredom. These impres­ sions began to throw some light on her feeling that she must fill the sessions with emotional fireworks of rage and sexuality, otherwise the analyst would be withdrawn from her like her mother. It was also apparent that Celine felt she must always seek excitement— through rage, through sexual pursuits and promiscuity, and through the use of stimulating recreational drugs. Such pursuit of
Page 127

> Celine also at times disclosed a very paranoid part of her mind that was continually suspicious of what might be going on in the other person's mind. This would be apparent in the transference, where she might feel the analyst was secretly fed up with her and was planning to end her therapy. However, it would often be very pronounced in relation to her boyfriend. She would on occasion search through his belongings for evidence of his having been unfaithful. Sometimes she would become convinced that he wanted to throw her out on the street and direct his love to a rival woman. Associations led to childhood fantasies that the arrival of her sister meant that she was to be eliminated and replaced by this new one. She recalled her profound suspicion when her parents gave her a soft toy, telling her that it was a present from the baby. Her natural incredulity at the idea of a baby giving her a present left her feeling she could not trust a word her parents said.

> "As with panic anxiety, most patients prefer to flee from shame rather than face it. To confront shame therefore requires a leap of faith on the part of the patient that they will not be abandoned by the analyst and will be able to tolerate the pain of the underlying affect"
> Bronheim, 1998, p. 83

> Shame and the threat of shame are pervasive features of human life. We are social beings, concerned with finding a place of recognition, approval and value in the complex
> society that human beings have created. If we fail to find such a place, there is nowhere else to go. Without a positive place in society, we must identify with the marginalized, the outcasts, the scape-goats—or else inhabit a no-place of psychosis. From the beginning of our lives, we strive to be understood, to be loved and to love. As adults, we need to make our contribution to the social world, through work, through mating, and through the protection and raising of the next generation. If w e fail i n any of these areas, w e feel shame. There ismuch that can gowrong—many ways in which

> to feel defective, inadequate, incompetent, unacceptable, unlovable, and an outcast. Moreover, it is not only our own failings that can lead to shame. Others may force us to feel shame through their ridicule and humiliating criticism—or through overt hostility and abuse. We may as children have been given the message not only that an aspect of our behaviour was unacceptable, but that our very being was bad and defective. Even when the creation of shame was not the intention,we can feel this through the failures of connection and empathic attunement in our childhood interactions with parents or other care-givers.
Page 138

> It is important to recognize that severe shame experienced in childhood is indeed a catastrophe—a psychic devastation—and to return there would be felt to involve a descent into madness and annihilation. If, despite this unconscious dread, the patient does bring his or her vulnerable and fragile self, then the responsibility given to the analyst/therapist is awesome. The responsibility is to provide a safe environment in which the early turmoils of shame can be revisited and worked through—but also, crucially, to avoid actively reshaming the patient. The latter can be extremely difficult in the face of the provocation of being made to suffer some partial elements of the patient's toxic experiences through projective identification and other interpersonal manoeuvres.
Page 139

> To hammer away at the analys and's transference distortions brings no results; it only confirms the analysand's conviction that the analyst is as dogmatic, as utterly sure of himself, as walled off in the self-righteousness of a distorted view as the pathogenic parents . . . had been. Only the analyst's continuing sincere acceptance of the patient's reproaches as (psychologically realistic), followed by a prolonged (and ultimately successful) attempt to look into himself and remove the inner barriers that stand in the way of his empathic grasp of the patient, ultimately have a chance to turn the tide. [1984, p. 182]

Page 146

> Shame in the transference
> If shame has been a particular feature of the patient's childhood experience, then inevitably there will be shame in the transference. Both patient and analyst will experience it. Even if the emphasis is mostly upon thepatient's sense ofshame, orfear ofshame, there will be moments when the tables are turned and the analyst is made to experience shame (in the form of feeling exposed, criticized, and revealed to be inadequate). A shame-prone patient may often have an accurate perception of real areas of narcissistic vulnerability in the analyst and these will be exploited in order to inflict shame. The analyst might endeavour to adopt an empathic stance and to avoid shaming the patient. To begin with this may seem to lead to a favourable response in shame-prone patients. Kohut notes that sometimes an initial positive development is then followed by an

> alarming deterioration, with a barrage of criticism against the analyst. He asks why there is this initial period of calm before a storm—and answers as follows:
> What happens is nothing else but the transference clicking into place. Thus during the calm before the storm, the analyst and the patient have jointly explored the patient's traumatic past, allied in the shared pursuit of a goal; once the storm breaks loose, however, the analytic situation has become the traumatic past and the analyst has become the traumatising selfobject of early life. [1984, p. 178]

> They are hypersensitive and easily hurt in everyday life and analysis. Moreover, when the sensitive narcissistic patient is treated in analysis as if he is the "thick-skinned" patient he will be severely traumatised. The analysis and the patient may be brought near to collapse, especially if the destructive aspects of a patient's behaviour are constantly repeated in the analyst's interpretations. Such patients can end the analysis very much worse off than before. In my experience the "thin-skinned" narcissistic patients were, as children, repeatedly severely traumatised in their feelings of self­ regard. They seem to have felt persistently and excessively inferior, ashamed and vulnerable, and rejected by everybody. ... such traumatised and vulnerable people find it very difficult to cope with any trauma or failure. However, one has to be particularly on guard not to add to these traumas by making mistakes in our analytic approach which humiliate such people and put them down. These mistakes are very difficult to remedy afterwards, [pp. 274^275]
Page 148

> However, a person may be greatly influenced by feelings of shame even when he or she has not suffered active shaming. This is because shame arises from all manner of failures of connection and understanding between one human being and another. If a child expresses a need, but this is not understood and met empathically, the child will experience shame. The subtlety and pervasiveness of such processes may be part of the reason w h y shame is often overlooked.
Page 154

> Repeated experiences in childhood of psychological needs not being recognized, understood empathically, accepted and met, may lead to those needs being concealed. A "false self may develop—built upon shame—such that an adaptation to the parental expectations hides the more authentic feelings and needs.
Page 154

> Jealousy is inherent in human behaviour and emotion and cannot be eradicated. It is an inevitable emotional corollary of the need to compete for limited resources, including sexual and reproductive resources (i.e. competition for a mate). Sexual jealousy has probably evolved as a very strongly entrenched strategy for protecting the transmission of one's own genes. This applies particularly to men. Men in general display stronger reactions to situations that might evoke explicitly sexual jealousy—the danger of the partner being impregnated by another man—whilst women show stronger reactions to the prospect of losing the man's love and loyalty.
Page 155

> The belief that jealousy is a sign of personality flaws, low self- esteem or insecurity, or abnormal wishes to control the partner, can be misleading and harmful, leading to additional and unnecessary feelings of shame. Both men and women have evolved emotional radar for detecting infidelity in their sexual partner. Attempting to deal with jealousy in a relationship by trying to ignore or cognitively minimize such feelings may be, as Buss (2000) notes, like responding to a fire by switching off the smoke alarm.
Page 155

> The encounter with a psychoanalyst or psychotherapist is fraught with potential shame. Some aspects of the psycho­ analytic stance can function to elicit underlying anxiety (and in that respect are useful), but at the same time can evoke shame (which can be inhibiting). There are ways in which the analyst can minimize the potential for unnecessary shame. This is important because patients will communicate only those aspects of their emotions that they expect to be understood and accepted; the rest will simply be concealed and may remain unconscious. Signals of shame tell the patient what is safe and what is not safe to attempt to communicate—but these signals are registered unconsciously.
Page 156

> Fundamentally, shame is about a broken connection between one human being and others—a breach in the understanding, expectation, and acceptance that is necessary for a sense of being a valued member of the human family. The cure for shame is the empathy provided by an other.
Page 156

> Psychoanalysis takes a developmental view of the emotional and mental health difficulties of the adult, seeing these as rooted, to a large extent, in the interpersonal experiences between child and parents (or other significant care-givers) in the first few years of life. Later stages are not ignored, since each phase of life poses its own challenges—and adolescence is particularly important—but the earliest years are regarded as the most crucial, since this is the period when the developing brain and personality are at their most vulnerable. This is also the time when the child is building up an internal map or model of the world, including the world of other people and relationships. The expectations of how other people will
respond to one's needs are laid down during these first few years and continue to influence our emotions and behaviour for the rest of our life.

Transference
> During psychoanalysis (or psychoanalytic psychotherapy), the analyst endeavours to bring to the light of consciousness the patient's (or analysand's) deep wishes, fantasies, and anxieties derived from childhood (and from the child parts within the mind of the adult) and to show how these are influencing the person unconsciously and contributing to difficulties that person is experiencing. An important focus of the exploration is the patient's relationship with the analyst—particularly in its more unconscious aspects. Those features of the relationship that are derived (transferred) from the childhood experiences and from the infantile parts of the adult are called the "transference".
Page 158

Free association
> The patient in analysis is not given any direction or structure regarding what to talk about, other than the request that he or she attempt as far as possible to speak freely of whatever comes to mind. This free-flowing kind of discourse is called "free association". An excellent discussion of this can be found in Bollas, 2002. In practice it is not really possible to speak entirely freely, because the person endeavouring to do so will encounter various anxieties and resistances—such as feelings of shame, fears of the analyst's disapproval, and so on. Much of the analytic work involves understanding these inner resistances.
