> Archie’s internal world is “filled with anxious fretting and grievance”. He
is resentful, easily offended, and constantly on the lookout for signs of
rejection. His needs are apparently insatiable. A particular conundrum
for the psychotherapist resides in Archie’s difficulty in making use of the
therapeutic relationship. As Cundy notes, “Rather than internalising the
care and attention he receives, he remains focused on what is missing”.
Archie’s difficulties are understood as having their origins in disturbed
early attachment relationships of a particular kind. Recognition of the
reality and nature of such disturbances form the common ground shared
by and investigated by all four contributors to this volume.

> Our attachment patterns lay the foundations of unconscious beliefs
about ourselves, and expectations we hold of other people and
relationships. These belief systems are played out in the
therapeutic relationship, influencing transference and counter-
transference, attitudes to boundaries, and how the therapy is used.

> Therefore the women whose relationships were in turmoil and who often
showed very troubled relationships with themselves (for example,
cutting themselves or being self-destructive in other ways) … seemed
haunted by something they could not resolve” (ibid.).

> What they discovered was that all of those with a borderline personality
disorder diagnosis “were enmeshed/preoccupied in their thinking about
their early relationships” (Hobson, 2004, p. 158).

###### Page 22

>Some individuals manage to contain their anxieties most of the time,
even appearing rather dismissing in their relationships with
others—until there is a crisis that shatters these defences and reveals a
core of preoccupation.

>Steve Farnfield said, “all people have an underlying strategy”.

>Brooding and anger reveal a different defensive strategy aimed at
preventing abandonment. I make sense of this by imagining an infant
with a rather tantalising but inconsistent mother. The original pattern of
attachment between them is ambivalent, and the child tries repeatedly to
recapture and hold onto mother’s love and attention. But eventually he
gives up, accepting that he cannot rely on her for containment, comfort,
or reassurance—he must learn to provide these for himself. And so he
does, until a later relationship breaks down and he is confronted with the
original yearning, love-hunger, and desperate need that he once felt for
his mother.

>Another possible scenario is the dyad where mother is loving and
attentive but her anxiety is too invasive.

###### Page 23

>The unifying factors among this spectrum of self-experience are the core
anxiety of being abandoned and patterns of defence aimed at preventing
separation; all else stems from this. From childhood on,
attachment-eliciting behaviours are resorted to in order to attract the
care and attention of others and hold on to them once their attention has
been captured.

>Anxiously Attached developed certain cognitive capacities,
discovers methods for protecting himself and his integrity from her
intrusions. But again, these more developmentally mature strategies can
be shattered by loss or threat of it in later life, triggering a regressive
return to the core attachment pattern. This often takes his family, his
circle of friends, and the person himself by surprise—they do not
recognise the person “he has become”. Winnicott wrote about people
who dread breaking down because they suffered the agony of ego
disintegration early in life and thus developed desperate defences to
protect themselves from returning to this terrifying disintegrated state
(Winnicott, 1974). The people I am thinking of here have already
experienced the terror of abandonment created by inconsistent
caregiving, and have then constructed different layers of defence against
a repeat of the original situation. Under certain circumstances, when
current relationships echo the first anxiety-provoking attachment,
secondary defence mechanisms (avoidance and dismissal of intimate
relating) break down to expose the original raw anxieties and the
clinging, demanding, primitive strategies to hold on to the other who is
needed as protector.

###### Page 25

>This kind of early environment discourages children from developing
skills that would enable them to function autonomously. Anxious and
inconsistent mothering makes children afraid to explore the world. They
grow up needing other people to help them manage many aspects of
their lives, and yet they also expect other people to be inconsistent and
let them down. If we cannot guarantee that there is somebody always by
our side as we negotiate life, we can at least ensure that there is always
someone occupying every corner of our internal world.

>The anxious stance … is encouraged by (1) unreliable care, which is
sometimes affectionate and at other times neglectful; (2) intrusive care
that is more related to the caregiver’s own needs and anxieties than to
the needs of the attached individual; (3) care that discourages the
acquisition of self-regulation skills and, directly or indirectly, punishes a
person for attempting to function independently; (4) comments that
emphasize a person’s helplessness, incompetence, or weakness when
trying to operate autonomously; and (5) traumatic or abusive
experiences endured when one is separated from attachment figures.
(Mikulincer, Shaver, Cassidy, & Berant, 2009, p. 297)

>But even when relational feeding is offered, he has difficulty taking it in,
holding on to it, digesting and being nourished by it. These “secure
attachment experiences” do not help him establish a secure base inside
himself. Rather than internalising the care and attention he receives, he
remains focused on what is missing.

>Making sense of other peoples’ minds helps us understand their motives
and predict their behaviours, which in turn helps us make realistic
judgements about threat, opportunity, action, and outcome. But for the
preoccupied individual, maternal inconsistency and conflicting.

>They have discovered how dangerous and dysregulating intimate rela-
tionships can be for them and fear risking their equilibrium, even their
sanity, by getting close to anyone again. This may seem inconsistent
with the need for attachment and attention, the fear of being alone. While
they appear to live rather solitary lives, their internal worlds are
populated with the ghosts of parents, friends, and ex-lovers who are
clung to obsessively, and actual relationships with real people in the real
world are often conflictual enough to guarantee that they continue to
exist in other peoples’ minds. Arguing, provoking resentment, and
blaming keep the heat turned up.

>A distinctive feature of psychotherapy with preoccupied clients con-
cerns boundaries. Anxiously attached clients may arrive early and often
overstay session times. They often seek out contact between sessions.

>Anxiously attached messages have left him vulnerable to
misreading other peoples’ intentions.

###### Page 30

>There is a wish to be special, to be made an exception, to be fed on
demand.

>Preoccupied clients often request a change of appointment time to
facilitate other aspects of their lives, or ask for extra appointments on an
ad hoc basis.

>Payment for private therapy can also present problems: it is painful to
pay for somebody’s care and attention

>Preoccupied clients endeavour to create an intimate, intense relationship with the therapist

###### Page 31

>A further difficulty in the work is due to these clients struggling to take in
good experiences and incorporate them. We can find our sensitive
empathic comments and carefully crafted interpretations rejected, especially after there has been an upset in therapy. Maggie Turp wrote of one
patient “devouring my words voraciously while at the same time refusing to hear what I was saying” (2012, p. 70).
Despite the hungry devouring, these clients so rarely feel nourished by what they consume.

>Preoccupied individuals are more likely to seek therapy than those with
dismissing attachment patterns because they are keenly aware of their
need for other people to help them manage life’s ups and downs. They
may initially idealise the therapist but their unconscious expectation,
based on their core internal working model, is that the therapist will
ultimately let them down and abandon them. And of course, they use all
the tactics available to them to push the boundaries and invite rejection.
Our job is to hold the boundaries and link these feelings and behaviours
to the past, where they originated.

>Preoccupied individuals make intense transference relationships. They
invest a great deal of importance in key figures in their lives, including
their psychotherapists, perceiving them as both the longed for, exciting

ideal mother and the disappointing, ineffectual, infuriating “mother who
fails”.

###### Page 33

>The practice of attachment-based psychotherapy places great emphasis on the healing value of mourning. All clients need to recognise and
grieve for what they have lost that was important, and what they have
been deprived of that is essential for healthy development. The therapist’s task is to facilitate the client engaging with the mourning process,
moving through it, and eventually looking to the future. If it happens to be
a loved one who has died, a fairly straightforward bereavement, then the
bereaved person must confront the reality of the loss and accept that his
world has changed forever. Feeling and expressing the pain, sadness,
and anger that are part of grieving, he can eventually let go of hope of
reunion, discover his own resources, and reconstruct a life for himself in
this changed environment. Other kinds of loss may seem intangible or
too distant to be significant, and there are defences in place to prevent
acknowledging the pain and damage done.

>It is unusual for a person whose attachment history is secure to seek
therapy, so I assume that the great majority of clients begin with an insecure attachment pattern—preoccupied, dismissing, or unresolved in
respect of trauma or loss. The aim is for the patient to develop ways of
being with other people and with himself that indicate he has “earned”
security. But what does this mean? And what needs to happen to bring
about the transformation?

>The internal working models that govern our perception of the world, of
relationships, and of ourselves are organised around a core anxiety—that
of being intruded on or being abandoned. The patterns of attachment
that develop from these anxieties were functional in early life, they got
results in terms of eliciting care and attention from our particular
caregivers in their particular context when we were most dependent on
them. However, these strategies for seeking connection with other
people and protecting ourselves from them are not so effective in adult
life. Another aim of therapy is to help clients modify their expectations of
relationships, to explore new ways of relating to others, and to modify
their original defences.

###### Page 34

>According to Holmes: “The overall goals of therapy can be summarized
as the search for intimacy and autonomy [where] the capacity for intimacy arises out of attunement, while a sense of autonomy comes from
the successful expression of healthy protest and, where loss is irretrievable, grieving” (2001, p. 49).

>When a client recognises that he was denied experiences that are
fundamental to happiness, self-esteem, and security, we hope that he
can begin to feel compassion for himself as a child. Rather than con-
tinuing to deprive himself of good experiences, or tormenting himself
with fears, or feeling crippling shame at his perceived inadequacies, we
aim to help him transform his relationship with himself. In order to bring
about such a radical change, he needs to internalise positive experiences
with other people, including the therapist, to form the basis of a new
“internal secure attachment object”, a resource that can help to calm him
when his anxiety is escalating, protect him from situations that could be
dysregulating, encourage his efforts, delight in his successes, and
forgive his failures.

>True “intimacy” requires two autonomous individuals who enjoy times
of emotional closeness as well as time apart. Each has a mind of his or
her own.

>True “intimacy” requires two autonomous individuals who enjoy times
of emotional closeness as well as time apart. Each has a mind of his or
her own. For anxiously attached individuals, close relationships are
often more enmeshed than truly intimate; they are most comfortable
when the unit comprises two people whose needs, wishes, and ways of
being are symbiotically tangled up. And for children whose attachment
figures are unreliable, autonomy cannot develop. They need to stay
focused on the parent, try to read his or her changing moods, and attend
to the parent’s needs in order to receive some scraps of security. If the
caregiver was anxious, depressed, addicted, or simply overwhelmed, it
was never safe to protest in the service of autonomy. Winnicott wrote
about the child’s need to attack and “destroy” the mother with whom he
is symbiotically fused in order to establish himself as separate from her
(1969). But this is not possible when mother is too frail or unstable to
tolerate the attack. Later, as a preoccupied adult, angry protest is
intended to keep the other engaged and involved rather than create a
boundary between two autonomous individuals.

>Preoccupied individuals are frequently unsettled by contact with certain
people; every communication seems to stoke distress...

>Preoccupied individuals are “high reactors” to stress (Gerhardt, 2004).
As infants, their experience was of attachment figures who were poor at
regulating the child’s emotional and physiological states. As a result,
their base levels of the stress hormone cortisol are relatively high. On top

of this, as children, they needed to exaggerate emotions such as anger,
fear, or distress in order to reach a caregiver who might otherwise not
respond. Intense feelings are the hallmark of this pattern of attachment,
along with difficulty regulating hyper-aroused states. In particular, they
struggle to disengage from negative affect (Nelson, 2009).

>the capacity for true intimacy and autonomy, the achievement of earned
security, will only be possible if he feels held by his own boundaries, able
to choose what he shares with others, how much of himself to give, and
when to say no.

>The preoccupied client lacks a well-developed part of the self that stands
back and observes his own reactions to events, the rise and fall of
particular emotions, shifting body states, emerging thoughts and
memories, impulses and behaviour. It is an important foundation for
psychotherapy to enable such an observing ego to develop. By distanc-
ing himself a little from the drama, he can consider the connections
between the trigger event, what happens in his internal world, and his
impulse to action. He has the opportunity to choose a different response
and to experience others responding differently to him. Impulse control
can be achieved, minimising the fallout from escalating conflict.

###### Page 44

>Here is an extract from an email sent to me by a patient I have worked
with for many years. I include it not out of vanity but because she
expresses so vividly the relief that comes with having a theory of mind:
“Your words mean so much to me. Sometimes I envy you with your
abundant knowledge of the secrets of the mind and unconscious.

>Rage is a protest about good things that were experienced then lost.
Kleinians would refer to this as the achievement of the depressive
position.

>Being secure in themselves, they are able to imaginatively identify with
others; taking for granted that they are loved, they can be interested in
other people without feeling threatened, and can feel for them when they
are unhappy.

>You shed light in grey places. It’s helped me
to learn about me and my world and the greater world about me. Nothing
feels as good as that.

>Of ambivalently attached children, he notes that they can be sensitive to
the moods of others, especially parents, but that this is not evidence of
true empathy. Their attention is focused on how and when to approach
their attachment figures, their anxiety levels are frequently high, and
these are not the optimal requirements for empathy or real concern for
others to flourish.

###### Page 46

>This again highlights the importance of firm therapeutic boundaries. The
routine of relating during fifty- (or sixty-) minute therapy sessions, with all
the rituals that evolve over time, helps the preoccupied client hold on to
memories between appointments and when the therapy eventually ends.
He is able to summon up the image of his psychotherapist, hear her
voice in his mind, picture her expression and gestures, and remember
her interventions—those that stand out for him as important and also the
background generic ones. Then, when needed, he can call upon this new
internal resource to calm and contain himself, to help him observe his
feelings, impulses, and motives before acting, to create thinking space,
and to challenge himself.

###### Page 47

>Another form of this self-sabotage reflects unrequited longing: “If you
see how much I suffer, you may change your mind and love me again.” I
have come across this often when romantic relationships come to an
end.

>I also provide evidence of holding the client in mind, between sessions
and over the course of therapy. I do not follow Bion’s recommendation
that we act “without memory or desire” (1967). I believe it is essential
that preoccupied clients know they exist in our minds without needing
to create a drama to ensure they are thought about. I also believe it is
helpful to reflect on the history that is created between the two of us. “I
remember you telling me a similar dream before”; “I seem to remember
you really struggled this time last year too”; “Do you remember when we
first met? I asked you why you thought you are an only child. Do you
remember your answer?” Anxiously attached individuals are afraid of
abandonment. Having to manage alone is unthinkable, so it is preferable
to cling to bad objects. Winnicott pointed out that we are never truly
alone if we have good objects populating our internal worlds (1958).
They are a resource to converse with and call upon. They enable us to
act autonomously.

###### Page 48

>I have suggested that preoccupied individuals are “stuck” at an early
stage of mourning, that they resist accepting the reality of loss with all
that entails. By continuing to suffer and protest, our patient avoids
feeling the despair that grieving entails. It is better to be angry than
depressed—anger and pain can help him feel alive when he so fears
losing others and himself.

###### Page 63

>Type C strategies are referred to in the literature by a number of terms
such as anxious ambivalent, preoccupied, coercive, and obsessive. The
distinguishing features are ambivalence about close relationships (Do
you really want me? How do I know that you love me? Are you secretly
planning to leave me?), together with intense displays of attachment-
seeking behaviour that can take the form of excessive anger or demands
for rescue. Whereas in the world of Type A, attachment behaviour is terminated too soon, in Type C it is extended longer than necessary. Rather
than comfort and security, which allows attachment behaviour to be
turned down, the person in Type C feels safest (in strategy) when they
are actually engaged in a struggle. (Throughout this chapter, people are
referred to as being in Type C. This is to avoid seeing the person in terms
of the strategy.) This can reach the point where a solution to a relation-
ship problem is actually perceived as threatening because, without the
problem, there is no struggle and the subject feels invisible.

>Top-drawer mentalizing means being known and understood by our
parents so that we in turn can understand that other people have states

###### Page 73

>An attachment strategy is just that—strategic. It functions to protect the
self. Adults often come to therapy because a strategy that was
functional in childhood no longer works in adulthood.

###### Page 90

>As we have been reflecting in this book, people with preoccupied strategies live in fear of losing their significant other, they over-attend to their
negative feelings of fear and anger, and sometimes express these in an
exaggerated way. This amplification of feelings can increase anxiety in
the person themselves as well as alienating those around them. This
chronic attachment insecurity is sustained by a very bleak set of internal
working models: a model of self as needing care but not deserving it; a
model of other as able to give care but not willing to do so. Mikulincer
and Shaver summarise the combination thus: “energetic attempts to
attain greater proximity, support and love combined with a lack of con-
fidence that it will be provided” (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2010, p. 272). They
also point to the relentless quality of the experience: Although anxiously
attached people have a history of frustrating interactions with
attachment figures, they still believe that if they intensify their
proximity-seeking efforts, they may force relationship partners to pay
attention and provide adequate support. (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2010, p.
273)

>For the child with a preoccupied strategy, internal and external are in
conflict: their fear of abandonment prompts them to signal distress and
to “cry for help”, while their need to conform forbids this.

>Authentic emotions are informative and may prompt us to solve a
problem. Authentic sadness is about the past—I need to mourn;
authentic anger is about the present—I need to assert myself; authentic
fear is about the future—I need to take preventative action (Stewart,
1989).

>Like a traveller who never finds their destination, or a hungry person
who does find food but is unable to swallow, they have the experience
of being destined to seek help from which they can never benefit.

>Wallin’s observation chimes with the research indicates that people with
preoccupied strategies favour sex as a route to closeness, whereas
those with dismissing patterns are more likely to enjoy a more aloof kind
of sex that minimises closeness (Feeney, 1999).

>Sometimes the erotic transference is an important waystation for the
preoccupied patient en route to the development of a deeper capacity to
trust and to love. But if the therapist is either too pleased or too
discomfited by the patient’s desire, that welcome development may be thwarted. (2007, p. 234)

###### Page 102

>Gratitude is about having the capacity both to know we are benefiting
and to enjoy that. The individual with strong preoccupied traits is
condemned always to be scanning for where the next meal is coming
from, never to be sitting calmly and basking in the pleasure of what is
currently to hand.

>People with preoccupied strategies can rarely enjoy the feeling of
gratitude; if we are in a preoccupied state with our attachment
relationships, to be grateful would risk signalling that things are good
enough, and this could seem to almost invite abandonment.

>Other writers who illustrate the experience of loss for a preoccupied
person, while not referring explicitly to attachment patterns, are Adelman
and Malawista. They describe: extensive periods of rumination … a
continual revisiting of the death. This type of depression prevents painful
emotions from transforming or being repaired. Instead, the bereaved
remains frozen at the threshold of loss, unable to work through the
death. (2013, p. 6)

###### Page 103

>Stroebe and Schut (2001) have introduced us to the idea of mourning as
an oscillation between loss and restoration, and they argue that it is the
capacity to move between the two states that helps us mourn and move
on. We need the sad times when we are immersed in the pain, but we
also need space for positive re-appraisal and moving on. This rhythm is
important because it helps us recognise the loss, while protecting us

from overwhelming despair. Their research matches Adelman and
Malawista’s poetic description of the ebb and flow of pain: The mourner
can begin to integrate the reality and finality of the loss in small doses
that ebb and flow in and out of our awareness. (2013, p. 11) Stroebe and
Schut found that people with a more ruminative style in early
bereavement were more likely to be depressed six months on, while
those with more a distractive style were less depressed (2001, p. 4).
They hypothesise more precisely as to how ruminative thinking may
prolong grief, suggesting that it exaggerates the effect of negative mood,
intrudes into active, instrumental behaviour, and interferes with effective
problem-solving.

are loath to give up the pain of loss because it binds us still to whom or
what we’ve lost.

>“The illusion of unity and control is shattered” (2000, p. 82), pointing us
to Winnicott’s understanding about the need for gradual disillusionment
as the mother presents reality to the growing infant at a pace that is
bearable (1969).

>every advance in the process of mourning results in a deepening in the
individual’s relation to his inner objects, in the happiness of regaining
them after they were felt to be lost … in an increased trust in them and
love for them. (Klein, 1940, in Mitchell, 1986, p. 164)

>In a way, all therapy is about mourning and, as Holmes has argued, about
helping clients get their stories into a more viable shape. Writing about
endings, he says: The task is not so much to get it right, as to use the
ending as a powerful exemplar from which the client can learn about the
ways his or her unconscious shapes the way he or she handles and has
handled, loss and separation. (2010, p. 70)

>When the work goes well and a client’s preoccupied strategy can be
relaxed, hypervigilance will reduce, and they will begin to take the risk of
staying with good feelings. Authentic feelings can be trusted; display
feelings will feel less necessary. Instead of an arching away, there is a
leaning in, and there is more of a self that can be trusted and loved. This
might not be quite Klein’s happiness of regaining what was felt to be
lost—because that phrase suggests return to a golden age. This journey
is about going to parts of the self that formerly we felt we had to avoid,
and finding that they can be loved.
