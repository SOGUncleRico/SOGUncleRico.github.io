Sex Without Shame: Encouraging the Child's Healthy Sexual Development by Alayne Yates

> Why is cupid always portrayed as an infant? To be in love is to reexperience infancy.
**Page 12**

> If we fear the monster within, then we dread the monster in our child.
**Page 33**

> It’s within this essential relationship that body intimacy develops. Body intimacy is a physical and emotional link which forms between the needy, dependent infant and his loving mother.
**Page 35**

> The mother’s emotional state is crucial during the construction of this link, for the child must find himself mirrored in his mother’s eyes. (Winnecott, 1971) If her response is eager and joyful, the infant views himself as valuable. He also derives a sense of goodness or badness from her reactions. If she babbles and smiles except when she changes his diaper, he soon understands that a certain part of his body is less acceptable than the rest.
**Page 35**

> Even Freud taught that masturbation sapped strength and produced a debilitating disease: “neurasthenia.”
**Page 47**

> Freud was reared in the philosophy of “Kinder, Küche, und Kirche.” After dinner, women were excluded as men retired together to the library for brandy, cigars, and good conversation. Freud proclaimed that “anatomy is destiny,” and inti mated that the clitoris was but a damaged penis. They were expected to stand in awe and envy as they viewed the magnificent male. Sexually inadequate, passive, and socially inferior, women possessed “the charm of a child.” Irrational, emotional, and dependent, they could compensate in part by bagging a husband and bearing his child. Men, of course, were aggressive, analytical, independent, and confident. (Gould, 1975)
**Page 48**

> This phenomenon is well known to the horse breeder who carefully pads the breeding stall, lest his expensive stud injure himself during coitus and thus refuse to mate thereafter.
**Page 50**

> Adult dysfunctions result from having understood the body or its function as bad, shameful, or dirty as a child.
**Page 51**

> Silently I modeled a large red PlayDoh penis on a baby doll. He stared at it intently for several moments. Abruptly, he flew at the doll and smashed the penis with his fist. “I know what that is!” he screamed. In the weeks that followed, more organs were constructed and demolished. I asked if he ever wanted to do that to himself. There followed a torrent of words interspersed with tears. His penis was “dirty, rotten, evil, and it stinks.” This was because he had played with himself even though he knew it was bad. He said, “If you did that God would hate you and kick you out of your house.”

> David’s parents were astonished. They had never punished David or told him that sex was evil. Fortunately, they under stood, and reassured David that he was not bad and would not be sent away. His father gave him permission to masturbate by relating his own early pleasures and concerns. David again read fluently and remembered to take pencils to class.

> Because David had little positive information or experience, he grossly misinterpreted events. Ashamed and miser able, he attempted to deny all erotic feelings, engaging only in clean respectable activities. This was all too much for David, and so he became symptomatic. If David had had reassurance, encouragement, and permission to engage in sex play, therapy would have been unnecessary.
**Page 56**

> Tractable, clean, and inhibited, Ann was shaped by her parents’ teachings. As she had not been taught that sexual pleasures were nice, she assumed they were part of the aggressive, dirty delights reserved for boys. Too frightened to express her resentment of males directly, she barricaded her self and denied her husband sexual pleasure.
**Page 62**

> Adult intimacy is the ability to blend with another’s mind or body and “let go” of many adult constraints. This presupposes comfort and trust—that the other person will not misuse or reject us. If we are unable to trust, we create emotional distance and avoid intimacy.
**Page 84**

> Sex and intimacy are associated from earliest childhood, when the infant is both close to and stimulated by his mother
**Page 84**

> The vibrator will never replace a flesh and blood lover, even when the lover has arthritis and poor timing. This is because the quality of life depends on intimacy—and who can be intimate with a vibrator? Sex serves to enrich and expand intimacy. It cushions the rough spots of living together and provides a vehicle for attachment in a society marked by alienation and loneliness. Many couples communicate directly, by touch, smell, and taste, only in bed.
**Page 85**

> When a man and a woman first commit themselves to each other sexually they do so for reasons that have been impressed upon them by society since childhood. They have been led to believe that on the basis of their union they will find physical, emotional and social fulfillment—and some people would include spiritual fulfillment as well. These are dimensions of human needs that have been intricately woven into “patterns” for commitment; woven and rewoven by successive generations from concepts of love and sex which reflected prevailing religious and cultural philosophies. ... Sex functions best when it is lived rather than performed and it can be lived best in a deep continuing commitment which is still most commonly a marriage.
**Page 124**

> Yet encouraging our children’s erotic development is scary. It depends on one basic assumption: that sex (like vitamins) is constructive and desirable. If so, then we want our children to experience plenty of good, nourishing, healthy sex.
**Page 132**

> Child development is like building a house. The basement is the most important, especially the cornerstones of the foundation. If this is well built, the structure resists stresses and strains, withstanding most environmental forces. Conversely, a minor defect in the foundation can cause continuing or recurrent problems.
**Page 141**

> The crucial shifts in emotional growth occur early also. We are just beginning to recognize the tremendous import of the first few months of life, when each child demonstrates a characteristic feeling state. One infant is cranky, while another is placid. Colic, circumstance, the mother’s ability to respond, and heredity all contribute to this emotional attitude which eventually colors the child’s outlook on life. The irritable, upset infant may later perceive the world as frustrating, unpredictable, or threatening. His mother’s ability to accept his body unconditionally and accurately sense his needs must certainly mediate toward a happier view of the world. A mother who rocks, soothes, and is sensitive to the infant’s needs gives him every opportunity to develop a positive feeling state.
**Page 141**

> The child needs to resolve each issue in turn in order to realize his full erotic potential. Feelings of inadequacy, shame, or resentment interfere with a favorable solution on any level.
**Page 142**

> Impairment at any developmental level has its effect; the earlier the impairment the greater the damage. For instance, the girl who never developed an erotic interest in her mother is hampered in forming sexual attachments to her play mates, or a pleasure bond with her husband. The twelve year old boy with a firm erotic foundation who is secretly enamored of his teacher is only temporarily shaken when she rejects his clumsy overtures. The foundation for the adult sexual response is well established in the first six years of life.
**Page 143**

> Body intimacy is the key to earliest erotic development. At no time is the individual more open to feel or less inclined to censure than in infancy. The baby’s whole body is a sexual organ. The joy of being held and caressed is fully appreciated in the first year of life. The kinesthetic delight of being swooped up in a parent’s arms is learned and may later be revisited by making love on a swing. The free palm of the suckling infant which massages the other nipple, or a button on mother’s blouse, contributes to the worldwide significance of a fingertip placed in the palm of a hand. The infant who inhales its mother’s smell while lustily nursing is paving the way for what the French recognize as the greatest of all erotic enhancements—the scent of a beloved.
**Page 151**

>The child who isn’t certain of your feelings needs clarification and extra reassurance.

>Once established, shame is impossible to erase completely. It’s the basis for the majority of problems treated in the sex clinic. Shame is the reason why it’s difficult for adults to ask for certain pleasures, admit inadequacies, reveal the genitals, or even talk about sex.
**Page 171**

>Shame is transmitted to children at an age when words are less important than actions.
**Page 173**

>Her blanket is her comfort and pleasure. If it’s dirty, so is Alice. If Daddy dislikes it, he objects to her also and the pleasures she receives from her blanket. Daddy needs to talk nicely to the blanket and to Alice before he gently removes the tattered remnant and dunks it in the washing machine.
**Page 174**

>Both parents need to discuss the event with the child. Because the child commonly pictures his mother as the victim.

>If the father grabs, and the mother says, “For heaven’s sake, I’m cooking dinner!” the child assumes that mothers, or girls, don’t like sex. An open, robust hankering for one another aids the child in establishing a positive attitude toward sex.
