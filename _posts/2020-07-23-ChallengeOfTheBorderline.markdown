> The two processes which are enduring consist of (1) a particular cognitive style, marked by poorly focused thinking, self-rumination, transient dissociative states, disorganization under stress, and the use of impulsive action to short-circuit unpleasant mental states, and (2) an emotional intensity or lability which is felt by the patient as over- whelming. The two key themes around which many of the behavioral symptoms are organized relate to concepts of (1) victimization, and (2) loneliness/emptiness. It is the combinations of these styles and themes, in varying mixtures and degrees of severity, that produce the borderline picture.
-Page 53


> To summarize, the cognitive style of borderlines involves a lack of balanced attention to details; a reduced ability for information processing, including registration, integration, and problem solving; a tendency to reach skewed conclusions derived from the incomplete and distorted information processing; selective memory problems involving partial amnesias, distortions of memory content, and at times large memory gaps for entire periods especially of childhood.
-Page 56


> interspersed with occasional intrusive pieces of traumatic old memories which cannot be forgotten; distractibility; altered states of consciousness and a tendency toward cognitive disorganization and transient psychotic episodes under stress.
-Page 57


> It is difficult to describe in words the "mental" state of a person who is becoming cognitively disorganized. To some extent, "cognitive disorganization" consists of a worsening of some of the features (vague, global percepts; repetitive imagery) mentioned above. The person becomes confused, emotionally distraught, and seems to lose the ability to reason logically. The young woman who thought that I had said that I wished to terminate therapy with her finally said to me, when I tried to clarify what I thought I had said, "I can't under- stand your words; I hear you, but I don't know what your words mean."
-Page 57


> As cognitive disorganization begins (or as more adaptive thinking departs), a few key verbal themes, usually of a negative valence ("I am alone; I am being rejected; I am a bad person") or a few powerful images, also of a painful or violent theme, recur and come to dominate the consciousness of the person, with the accompanying loss of more stable compensatory ideas and percepts
-Page 57


> Borderlines' intense focus and perseveration upon negative themes often merge into varying degrees of confused thinking and cognitive disorganization, leading in turn to several, possibly dangerous out- comes. One is that the borderline will try to short-circuit this painful state by outwardly directed impulsive action: running out of the house, place of work, therapist's office or hospital ward; driving an automobile aimlessly and recklessly; drinking alcohol or abusing drugs or even overdosing; self-mutilative acts such as cutting wrists or other parts of the body; placing himself or herself in danger by picking up strangers, going into unsafe neighborhoods, or becoming intoxicated at bars.
-Page 59


> It is not clear to what extent the patient is overwhelmed by the "brief psychosis," as the trance state might at times be termed, and to what extent there remains some control over the misperceptions and sense of panic, some exaggeration for the sake of the onlookers when present, and some observing ego. At times borderline patients can be talked down from their "brief psychotic episode." At times no intervention seems to help, for all attempts to intervene or to avoid intervening are equally thwarted by an intensification of the symptoms, as is illustrated in the following case.
-Page 59


> It does not appear to be true that all borderline patients have suffered sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence. Nor can it be said that all those who have been sexually assaulted develop a borderline picture. We do not know enough about the influence which variables such as age of onset and duration of assaults, violence and viciousness, subtle factors of intimidation, seduction, rewards and sympathy, surrounding circum- stances, family constellation, constitutional factors, sources of sup- port, and peer relationships have upon development of or protection from borderline traits.
-Page 64


> The important point to recognize is that from the patients' perspective the feelings they are experiencing are very intense and, in fact, overwhelmingly so. In working with borderline patients, it really does not matter what we think about the genuineness of their emotions. It does matter that we appreciate that, to them, their feelings are intensely felt. Many of their maladaptive behaviors, such as self-mutilation, desperate avoidance of aloneness, and impulsive actions, stem from their subjective inability to tolerate their intense, subjectively experienced feeling-states.
-Page 66


> Borderlines rarely tolerate neutral relationships, instead driving each relationship toward greater and greater emotional involvement and intensity, as if nothing else mattered. At other times they abandon the relationship (or perceive themselves as being abandoned) with great emotional despair. The borderline has the ability to evoke (or provoke) strong feelings in others, and the partner in the relationship, whether spouse, lover, friend, parent, child, or therapist, is frequently caught up in this emotional intensity and equally loses perspective, consequently participating in playing out the dominant pathological themes of the borderline patient. When this happens in the therapy situation, we have the well described and painful transference-countertransference problems (see Chapter 8).
-Page 66


> The other pervasive theme that frequently dominates the clinical picture is the borderline's sense of loneliness and inner emptiness. It is, as usual, difficult to assign primary causahty to one rather than the other, such as postulating that the inner emptiness fuels the sense of loneliness, or conversely, that the condition of being alone produces both the conscious awareness of an inner emptiness and the painful emotional state that is an integral part of emptiness. It is also difficult, or perhaps not meaningful, to conceptualize emptiness without incorporating aspects of the theme of victimization or of any of the other themes which we shall shortly discuss. However much we may speak of fragmented egos or personalities, these are merely metaphors which attempt to convey a less than healthy degree of integration; such metaphors ought not to be taken literally.
-Page 75


> In either case, when feeling (frantically and/or intolerantly) isolated and disconnected, abandoned or alone, the borderline will sometimes begin to self-mutilate to end this intolerable state, to justify seeking help, or to express one of several other persisting themes.
-Page 76


> If the borderline does not get swept up in the social situation and let go of the painful introspective process, the sense of being alone in a crowd, of being an empty mannekin play-acting a social role, is only increased. This social behavior accompanied by a sense of self-conscious inauthenticity forms one of the modes of experience sometimes referred to as the "as-if" personality, which is at times seen in borderline patients.
-Page 77


> The sense of emptiness may be a transition to a state of depersonalization or derealization. I am not suggesting that this is the major pathway to depersonalization or derealization, but only that some- times borderlines' preoccupation with their sense of alienation and disconnectedness proceeds to the feeling-state that things are unreal. At times, not only does their sense of self-consciousness painfully isolate them from other people, but it even isolates them from their own body as a physical object and as that part of themselves which walks, talks, reaches for a cigarette, hears a conversation, or engages in sexual behaviors.
-Page 78


> Since most persons with mental or emotional problems are unhappy at many levels about their condition, are often demoralized, and often see no effective means of improving either their inner state or their external circumstances, shall we then call all emotional problems depression? To do so in the case of the borderlines' experience of emptiness is to ignore an important cognitive feature of the experience, namely the morbid rumination and self-consciousness with
-Page 78


> which they scrutinize their own thought processes. This self-scrutiny at times resembles a form of obsessional thinking in which the objects of the thinking are the thought processes themselves. Many borderlines will think about what they are thinking about or will think about themselves thinking about themselves. Such a cognitive state produces a sense of dysphoria or perhaps at times is itself driven by a primary feeling of dysphoria, or, as we have suggested before, the cognitive process and the feeUng-tone are components of a unified state. The state is painful and self-perpetuating, in that, once begun, shifting out of it is difficult. At times the state occurs spontaneously; at other times the borderline seems to encourage it by focusing on certain memories which almost self-hypnotically lead to an increased sense of alienation and emptiness.

> However, this is as much an inherent style as it is an intentional "replaying of old movies." The style includes a preoccupation with questions of what is real, of whether the public self bears any resemblance to the inner self, of whether the inner self is the real self, of whether there is any inner real self, of whether relationships with others are real. The following vignette gives some sense of this phenomenon.
-Page 79


> CASE 9
> The 20-year-old college student discussed in case 1, while at the state hospital, went out on pass with several girlfriends. Initially in a fairly good mood despite some anxiety about being out of the hospital, she was enjoying the time with her friends when she started becoming aware of her own thoughts while in a shopping center. She looked about and saw people seeming to go about their daily business in a normal and unself-conscious way. This soon progressed to thinking that all of them seemed to be functioning as automata. She wondered how they could behave so naturally, as if they did not recognize the enormous gulf which separated each person from every other. She herself felt totally alienated and removed from the rest of humanity. All daily activities seemed meaningless and futile, a mere charade to conceal from oneself the essential isolation of each individual. She felt like cutting herself, but was able to convey this to her friends, who then kept a close watch over her.
-Page 79


> One of the cardinal features of borderlines is their subjective sense of emotional intensity.
-Page 84


> It makes sense that patients will try to get their needs met in therapy. The uniqueness of borderlines is that they seem to feel their needs so intensely, as we have discussed, and that they are so resourceful, demanding, at times frantic and manipulative, and often unpleasant when thwarted, in regard to getting their needs met. They do lose perspective of other people's needs and rights. Nevertheless, the sense of entitlement is often balanced by a private sense of un- worthiness and innate evil, which seems to contradict the narcissism of entitlement. This sense of unworthiness does not appear to be just dependent upon a depressive mood state, but at times seems to be a core part of the identity of the borderline, often founded upon a series of childhood abuses or rejections
-Page 87


> One of the most prominent features of borderline patients is the difficulties that characteristically arise in their treatment.
-Page 122


> In fact, the present concept of borderline, derived from the formulations about pseudo neurotic schizophrenia, initially took shape from the very observation by therapists that some of their presumably neurotic patients were becoming worse as a result of the stresses of psychodynamic psychotherapy.
-Page 122


> The central thesis of this chapter is that the therapist, in working with borderlines, must concentrate primarily on what is going on in the therapy session itself and less on an elaboration of the borderline psychodynamics and hypothesized developmental failures of the patient. The structure of therapy itself is more important than the structure of the borderline's ego development. Within the process of therapy, key borderline themes, such as victimization, loneliness/ emptiness, incompetency, and entitlement, will arise and provide the subject matter of the therapy. Therapy entails ongoing judgments as to the optimal balance of supportive and exploratory interventions with the patient. This is the heart of therapy.
-Page 122


> The features of borderline patients that characteristically make them difficult therapy cases are their emotional intensity and inter- personal demands for engagement, their difficulties in cognitive processing, and their tendency toward dramatic impulsivity. I am re- minded of a passage in Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises in which a duel between the matador and the bull is described. There is a proper distance between the protagonists within which the interaction most meaningfully occurs. If the matador is too concerned with his own safety, he maintains too great a distance between himself and the bull, so that little engagement occurs. If the matador works too closely to the bull and is too reckless, either because of concern for his own image or because of ignorance of the risks involved, then he is likely to be gored.
-Page 123


> Borderline patients, by virtue of their interpersonal demands and threats of self-destruction, stir up intense feelings which often touch upon the therapist's own core issues of activity and passivity, caretaking and exploitative, and tolerance for anger and anxiety. These countertransference responses will be considered in Chapter 8. The therapist who works well with borderlines is the therapist who enjoys and is able to work at the proper degree of engagement with these types of patients. Such a therapist is not more virtuous than the one who works with obsessionals or alcoholics or depressives; it is
-Page 123


> primarily a matter of fit between the particular psychopathology of the patient and the particular tolerances and idiosyncrasies of the therapist. While therapeutic failures or even temporary setbacks are sometimes noisier with borderlines than with many other patients, each type of patient — and each individual patient — presents particular challenges and difficulties.
-Page 124


> CORE BORDERLINE FEATURES
> The core features which must be addressed in therapy are the ones discussed in Chapter 2. These include victimization in all its subtle and gross forms, namely, submissiveness, passivity, and eagerness to please; provocativeness; self-destructive behaviors; and incompetence and the many attempts of the borderlines to justify their perception that there is an external locus of control to their Hves. The other core features are a tendency toward cognitive disorganization; demoralization, depression, and emotional dysregulation; impulsivity; interpersonal intensities and maladaptation's and the borderline's needs for affection and attention; a sense of entitlement; suggestibility and romanticization in relationships; identity issues; the tendency toward splitting notions of themselves and others in either good or bad totaUties; anger and dependency and the need for love and approval.
-Page 128


> In exploratory therapy, especially of a psychodynamic type, working with the transference, especially the negative one, is a central feature.
-Page 134


> The problem with this dichotomy is that it is oversimplified and breaks down particularly when applied to the treatment of borderlines. The usual recommendation for the psychotherapist who is not psychoanalytically trained and who is seeing a borderline patient in once-a-week outpatient therapy is that the therapy had best be supportive in order to avoid the inevitable emotional and behavioral storms that accompany the negative transference of "more intensive" psychotherapy. But as we have all discovered when trying to do just supportive therapy with volatile and self-destructive borderline patients, our supportive therapy gets us into all sorts of troubles'. The pitfalls that may follow rapidly upon overly enthusiastic or ill-considered supportive therapy include infantilizing the patient, aggrandizing the wisdom of the therapist, falling into splitting maneuvers set up by the patient, and the tendency of some patients to sabotage suggestions or to blame themselves (and, indirectly, the therapist) for not being able to carry out the therapist's suggestions. In essence, there is the possibility that the patient will assimilate the therapist into her ongoing pathological schema as one more intrusive, rejecting, or impotent adult.
-Page 134


> The basic question is whether psychotherapy can be supportive and still deal with process. I prefer to use the iQxva process rather than transference because transference is a more narrowly restrictive and technical term. In fact, I am suggesting that supportive therapy that is process-oriented is ideally suited for working with borderlines. It permits the therapist to engage the patient in the arena of the patient's interpersonal psychopathology. Behaviors such as threats of or actual self-mutilation, indirect requests for rescue operations, com- plaints about other therapists or counselors, and obHque demands for special treatment can ultimately be dealt with therapeutically only by discussing the process of therapy with the patient. This is true whether one is talking about a behavioral management program to help the borderline decrease the self-defeating patterns or employing a traditional verbal psychotherapy, as is the subject of this book.
-Page 135


> Because the borderline patient has often been damaged interpersonally in the past and tends to move toward misinterpretation and cognitive disorganization under stress or rejection, it is often (not always) best to focus upon process within a supportive psychotherapeutic mode. This essentially consists of using the operations listed in window C as the principal modality, although frequent excursions into the other windows must of course occur. The main intervention in the psychotherapy of borderlines must be the repetitive examination in a supportive manner of the process that is occurring between patient and therapist.
-Page 135


> Sooner or later, the patient must deal openly with the therapist. There is no such thing as a neutral therapist in the therapy of border- lines. The therapist, either inadvertently as a result of the patient's acting-out or intentionally as part of working with the core interpersonal dynamics of the borderline patient, will get pulled into an intense involvement with the borderline.
-Page 135


> When straightforward supportive techniques prove insufficient to contain the borderline's pathological behaviors, the only, and the best, recourse is for the therapist to process with the patient what is occurring between the two of them. This involves confrontation rather than interpretation. The therapist does not have to interpret why the patient is behaving in such a manner. The important task is to point out the pattern as it affects the patient-therapist relationship.
-Page 136


> She described a growing feeling of panic during each session as she realized that her "time was almost up" and she had not had a chance to tell me all that she felt had to be said, nor had she gotten from me enough words or a sense of caring and concern to make her feel better or to help get her through the week.
-Page 141


> The major point I wish to make here is that in therapy there are innumerable choice points at which the therapist can either remain at a supportive and concrete level or move to a process level
-Page 142


> The therapist states overtly that the focus of therapy is not the unraveling of the childhood roots of past and present problems or the exquisite exploration and expression of how unhappy or anxious or angry the patient is about all that has happened and is happening to her. Rather, the initial focus shall be on the rational discussion of how the patient will avoid setting up or falling into those situations in which she becomes helpless, victimized, self-destructive, and, in general, incompetent to carry out the major expectations and tasks of her life.
-Page 144


> Therapy does not proceed in such a linear fashion. Patients are not so cooperative. Therapists often lose focus. Crises frequently derail prearranged
-Page 145


> agenda. I would emphasize that one must distinguish between major goals, principles, modes, and directions and the inevitable side trackings, perturbations, backslidings, and tangentialities which occur in therapy.
-Page 146


> Perhaps most risky of all therapies is that in which the transference becomes the primary focus of therapy and the patient is left unsupported to deal with the excitement and emotional intensity stirred up by such a method.
-Page 148


> My own sense is that the most productive work with a borderline patient can be done in a supportive process-oriented mode of therapy. Patient and therapist proceed to examine in a supportive manner those issues in the patient's life which are troublesome, but in addition the therapist frequently comments and invites examination of what is occurring between the two participants at any given moment and within the larger unfolding of the therapeutic relationship.
-Page 148


> Finally, whatever the specific details of the therapeutic process, therapy with borderline patients needs to help the patient move to- ward greater competency in life. Enhanced competency is the goal of therapy. Most borderline patients are locked into maladaptive and self-destructive patterns in key areas of their lives. Realization of these patterns and the move toward improved functioning in relation to self and others are the criteria by which the effectiveness of therapy is to be judged.

 THERAPY OF EMOTIONAL INTENSITY
> There is not much point in debating whether borderline patients really feel their feelings more intensely than others do. For practical purposes, I accept as fact that, from the patient's point of view, feelings often seem to be overwhelmingly intense, and I tell this to the patient. "It seems to me," I say, "that you are the kind of person who feels your feelings very intensely, and that sometimes this causes you great difficulty." In the course of discussing this with the patient, I try to make it clear that this is certainly not a criticism, but merely a description or even just my hypothesis. "Furthermore," I add, "there may be great virtue in feeling one's emotions very intensely. After all, what is so great about being a dull and colorless person? But in your case, sometimes you get overwhelmed by the very intensity of your feelings. Let's look at it a little more closely."
-Page 158


> It is the emotional intensity of borderlines and the ensuing stormy interpersonal relationships which pull others, including therapists, into their orbit. I
-Page 158


> As in dealing with cognitive disorganization, the therapist's first task is to identify, characterize, and label the type of difficulty for the patient. It helps the patient to be able to place her troubles within some general category. Giving the symptom a name helps the patient conceptualize about the trouble and discern the pattern when variants of the behavior show up again. Finally, identifying and labeling something, even one's own emotional style, help to demystify the thing and reduce it to more manageable proportions. The therapist, in placing the type of trouble into simple and even mundane terms, is telling the patient that this sort of trouble fits within the known range of human reactions and is not so unique or bizarre as to place the patient beyond the pale of human experiences. "Emotional intensity may cause you troubles," the therapist in essence is saying, "but it is on the spectrum of how all people are, and as such, we can begin work with it."
-Page 159


 SUMMARY
> The goal of therapy is increased competency. This becomes particularly important in working with borderline patients on issues relating to their cognitive style and emotional intensity. In borderlines, both of these areas of functioning are particularly marked by incompetence. The hysterical cognitive style enables the patient to remain incompetent in problem-solving and in developing mature interpersonal relationships. Susceptibility to being overwhelmed by the intensity of one's emotions leaves the patient at the mercy of his or her own impulsiveness or the generosity or malevolence of others. The therapist's task in the face of these disturbances of basic mental functioning is to work, initially supportively and then possibly investigative, to help the patient appreciate how things go wrong. Anticipation of situations which provoke cognitive disturbances and over- whelming emotions enables the patient to gain better control of these functions. Recognition and exploration of these patterns during the therapy sessions give the patient and therapist the best opportunity to move from a content-based supportive mode to a process-oriented therapy.
-Page 163


> The supportive and slow-paced logic of therapy provides a model which the patient can utilize in gaining control over his inner emotions and interpersonal relationships.
-Page 164


> But the issue was not as simple as wrestling with herself about whether to commit suicide or not. Her need to test people and to set up situations in

-Page 167


> In discussing work or volunteer activities with this particular patient, I have told her that she is an intelligent woman and that she can be quite engaging and fun to be with when not caught up in her self-pitying postures. These responses fit into window A. Such statements provide direct gratification to a patient, and run the risk of sabotaging therapy by having the patient work only to obtain more compliments, by stimulating nurturing or romantic fantasies about the therapist, or by defusing an important negative transference that needs to be expressed.
-Page 170


> I would agree with the general principle that therapy must be directed toward enabling patients to achieve gratification of their needs outside of therapy rather than seeing therapy as the vehicle which does the gratifying
-Page 170


> Despite the dangers, however, I would insist that there is a place in the therapy of demoralized and isolated patients for some well-considered words of encouragement. Otherwise therapy remains too austere and ungiving for these particular patients to take the necessary steps toward competency and autonomy.
-Page 170


> The self-mutilation serves many purposes, including providing relief from the original unpleasant state. It is not clear exactly how and why this begins, but many borderlines will state that they have learn- ed that cutting is the only thing that terminates the intensely painful mental state. Beyond this sense of relief, however, the self-mutilation serves many symbolic functions. It represents an identification with the aggressor. It is also a demonstration of sorts that the self-mutilators can no longer be hurt by others because they have made them- selves immune to physical pain by going into a dissociative state.
-Page 171


> It is not necessary for detailed discussions to occur in order for the patient to stop mutilating herself.
-Page 172


> There are two fundamental levels for viewing and responding to the self-destructive actions of borderlines. One level consists of the subjective perspective of the patient. Borderline patients tell us that they are driven to cut and burn for several interrelated reasons. They mutilate themselves either in order to obtain temporary relief from their very painful inner states of estrangement, self-hatred, and dread or as an appeasement to their overwhelming sense that they have no right to live and ought to destroy themselves. However, it is also clear, whatever may be the truth of their subjective compulsion toward self- mutilation, that the cutting and burning which borderlines do usually
-Page 173


> occur within a social orbit in which their actions have a very powerful impact upon other people.
-Page 174


> In general, borderlines hurt themselves in proximity to other people or else bring their damaged and bleeding parts to the attention of others. The responses of others and the ensuing emotional and inter- personal entanglements appear critically important in reinforcing and maintaining the self-destructive patterns. It is almost impossible for family, friends, strangers, and therapists to avoid being caught up in the maelstrom initiated by borderline self-destructive threats and actions.
-Page 174


> I am suggesting that, since the very act of self-destructiveness forces itself upon the therapist's attention and demands an immediate response, the therapist of necessity has to take a stance which minimizes, for a time, the early Hfe history and intrapsychic elements and focuses on the interpersonal significance of self-mutilation.
-Page 174


> In addition, the self-destructive patient who continues or increases this self-destructive pattern in therapy presents a serious assault upon the therapist's own sense of competence. These behaviors dramatize to the therapist that he is impotent to stop the patient from acting-out and serve to question the very efficacy of therapy and the therapist. Should not a good and empathic therapist be able to get the patient to stop hurting himself, to interpret the transference if that is what is propelling the self-destructive actions, and to move the patient along the road of health? Instead the therapist ends up hurt, angry, and demoralized. Under such circumstances, it is too easy for the therapist to become caught up in his own personal needs to win the struggle with the patient.
-Page 175


> Whenever she becomes anxious, or someone or something frustrates her, or a concerted effort is needed to effect a change in her situation in the world, she immediately shifts into suicidal thinking and self-mutilative action.
-Page 181


> It is as if all the problem-solving synapses in her brain are bypassed by the rapid response toward self-destructiveness. Her repertoire of problem-solving is: "My back hurts . . . I'll kill myself; my social worker didn't answer my call . . . I'll cut myself; I burned my toast this morning . . . I'll kill myself; my psychiatrist wants to decrease my tranquilizers . . . I'll burn myself; I'm anxious when I think of work . . . I'll hang myself." She appears to have abandoned all efforts to think beyond the immediate response of self-destruction. I tell her that this is an old and comfortable pattern for her and that getting her out of this pattern and into a competent problem-solving pattern is our task. Of course, one cannot do therapy with a corpse and therefore her first task is to stay alive. To her reply that therapy is not doing enough, I have no soothing answer. Promises of success and exhortatory words of encouragement are another pitfall that needs to be avoided here. Otherwise the patient will continue to squeeze them out of the therapist at the cost of engaging in therapy.
-Page 181


> Therapy must move back and forth between examining the actual contexts within which self-mutilation occurs and the mental processes (cognitive and emotional) by which patients ruminate themselves into the semi-trance states that lead directly into cutting and burning.
-Page 182


> The process of therapy proceeds as a dialogue between two persons in which a topic — the content — is examined. The content of the dialogue moves back and forth from (1) a straightforward exposition of themes and events in the patient's life, to (2) an interaction in which the therapist tries to question, understand, advise, and confront the patient regarding events in the patient's life, to (3) a self-conscious examination of the emotions generated and events occurring in the very interaction between patient and therapist. In this latter possibility, the process itself becomes the content of the therapy hour. Therapist and patient are, in effect, processing the process.
-Page 187


> There is, and there is not, something special about the therapy of borderlines. Since character traits exist on a continuum, the features of borderlines which seem to cause major complications in therapy are also found in many nonborderline patients, sometimes to a lesser and sometimes to a greater extent. Paranoid features, dependency, wishes for approval, escape into fantasy, sensitivity to subtle rejection, tendencies to romanticize and eroticize, quickness to anger, impulsivity, provocativeness and testing limits, moral strictures, or a host of other elements are found in all patients. Correspondingly, therapists bring their own personalities, strengths and vulnerabilities, belief systems, needs for approval, and preoccupations with their own personal lives into the therapy situation.
-Page 204


> It is possible that, for a variety of reasons, borderlines have very sensitive radar systems when it comes to reading (or misreading) significant people in their lives.
-Page 205


> EskeHnen de Folch (1984) has commented upon the hysterics' ability to "use their perceptions of the therapist in such a form that the therapist is likely to be interested in them, stimulated, that is, and somehow seduced into an analytical relationship which is highly interesting but useless" (p. 406). The relationship is useless because the patient does not use the therapist's work to clarify anxieties and change behaviors, but to establish a particularly intense and exciting relationship with the therapist. The therapist, unless he appreciates this aspect of the transference, becomes caught up in the excitement and stimulation of the seemingly therapeutic process.
-Page 205


> In addition, the borderline's special combination of emotional intensity, use of splitting, disguised and overt victimization themes, suggestibility and acting-out propensities makes for a dramatic and difficult therapy. These features also account for the special attraction of borderlines. Therapy is never dull. Borderlines appear to have psychodynamics that are irresistible, that cry out for sympathy, exploration and in-depth understanding. They are usually bright, young and attractive. They are eager to talk about their troubles and they urgently seek out therapy. As therapist and patient engage in therapy, complications begin. What are the characteristics of the therapists which seem to predispose to these difficulties?
-Page 205


> borderline patients, be- cause of the particular qualities of their demands and susceptibilities, seem to bring out some of the worst features of the therapist. More than with most patients, the therapist will be confronted with issues of self-disclosure, closeness, response to angry attacks, flattery and seductiveness, suicide threats, impotence in the face of failure to improve, and transference of victimization. The problem arises when the therapist does not see these issues as problems relating to her own vulnerabilities and countertransference issues. Rather, she recognizes the psychopathology of the patient as the major issue and sees her own behavior only as reasonable reactions, albeit a little frenetic at times, to the excesses presented by the patient.
-Page 209


> The therapist must consider the many ways in which an ordinary social amenity, a "Good morning, nice weather we are having," or a "See you next week," is transformed when uttered in a therapy relation- ship. It is not that one should necessarily stop these little etiquettes, but merely that one should recognize the powerful impact casual comments may have in therapy. They are anticipated, scrutinized, and used by the therapist and patient for special purposes. They are most often used to convey a relationship of closeness and connected- ness between patient and therapist which is illusory, but seems to be necessary to soften the patient's awareness of his own isolation and despair. As such, these little amenities at times produce a short-term gain which ignores the long-term cost of coming to terms with the chasm between patient and therapist
-Page 210


> Borderline patients are often said to be prone to over idealization and devaluation. It is the former trait which plays into the therapist's need for flattery. Although this pattern of the borderline precedes her entry into therapy, it is likely that her careful observations of
-Page 210


> the therapist's facial and bodily expressions alert her when she is on target in touching a sensitive area of the therapist's personality.
-Page 211


THE NEED TO BE A CARETAKER AND THE FEAR OF ENGULFMENT
> This is an area which seems to strike at the very core of the difficulties of working with borderline patients. One of the characteristics of borderlines is their ability to evoke nurturing and caretaking sentiments in those around them. Borderlines often appear to therapists as long-suffering victims of the world's inhumanity, as unprotected waifs in desperate need of warmth and understanding. Most therapists wish to be caretakers. Needs and wishes mesh exquisitely. The usual pattern in therapy is that the therapist tries to do too much for the borderline patient. The response of the therapist after trying to do too much is either anger at the patient for being so demanding or fearfulness of being engulfed by the patient's insatiable demands. The usual response of the patient when the therapist tries to do too much is either regression into increased helplessness and neediness, with resultant anger when the demands finally cannot be met, or anger in the first place for encroachment upon her limited autonomy.

> Therapy is not a place where one's legitimate needs for companionship and physical intimacy can be gratified. Rather, the therapist works with the patient so that the patient can see to the gratification of these needs outside of the therapeutic situation.

> The therapist's remarks in this situation have the effect of closing off an examination of the issues which the patient has raised. Labeling a behavior and explaining its presence in a reassuring way almost certainly minimize its significance and prevent further exploration. For a variety of reasons, the therapist was not comfortable with the patient's open acknowledgment of his sexual interest in her. In telling the patient that it is a normal phenomenon, she diminishes its specific relevance to his mental life and loses the opportunity to explore why shame was the dominant accompanying emotion. She also loses the opportunity to connect his sexual feeling toward his therapist with the previously acknowledged theme of similar feelings for his mother. Despite the reassurances that such feelings (toward mother and therapist) are normal and nothing to feel shame over, in fact the therapist's response conveys otherwise. The result is a trade-off, but with losses that are not balanced by gains. The gain is that the patient, who is sensitive about such issues, may feel some reassurance that his therapist did not laugh at him or reject him when he disclosed his affectionate and erotic thoughts of her. The loss, in addition to the specific therapeutic opportunities which were not exploited at that time, is that the overall process has been redefined as one in which these issues will not be explored. Processes are redefined over and over again, however, so the loss is not catastrophic or irrevocable. The theme will probably emerge again, and new therapeutic opportunities will develop.

> We do not need to hit our borderline patients with a tire iron for them to feel the reality of our rejection. In fact, it is probably more important to try to process the response to rejection than it is to worry too much about the actual wording of a refusal, as long as one is not being intentionally unkind. The basic point is that we cannot, and ought not, to meet many of the patient's needs. This failure or refusal will be felt by the patient at various times as arbitrary, selfish, withholding, punitive and, always, painful. As best we can, we need to process these requests and the aftereffects of our refusals.

> Another area where this shows up frequently is in the request for a hug at the end of the hour. I think this occurs less frequently with psychiatrists, who are often more formal, than with psychologists and social workers. Hugging has been greatly promulgated by many drug treatment programs, touchy-feely therapies, and self-help groups. It is often presented as an innocent maneuver which provides affirmation and positive regard for the patient. I think this is naive. The problem is that patients who have been involved in a variety of therapies have come to expect the hug and to have some basis of experience in thinking that hugging conforms to standard therapeutic procedure. The therapist's refusal to provide the ritualistic body squeeze is thus doubly felt as a personal rejection or translated into evidence of the therapist's rigidity.

 CASE 35
> A 50-year-old divorced woman, recovering from years of dependency upon antianxiety medications and a hurtful divorce, asks her therapist for a hug at the end of the hour. "I feel like I need a hug," she says. Therapy, which began with this therapist six months earlier, has been mainly of a supportive mode, with not a great deal of emphasis upon insight, nor has the patient ever displayed a particular aptitude for introspection. The therapist, surprised by the request, physically backs off and tells the patient he will not give her a hug. The patient appears hurt and leaves. She cancels her appointment the following week. At the subsequent appointment, she ac- knowledges her disappointment, but denies that it had anything to do with the failed appointment or her present aloofness and petulance. The therapist tries to examine this episode with the patient, but without success. The issue is dropped and a supportive, content-oriented mode is resumed.

> Without being doctrinaire, I am against hugs in therapy. In the broadest sense, hugging loses sight of the distinction between gratification of the patient's needs and working with the patient to obtain gratifications outside of the therapy relationship. More specifically, it enables the patient to avoid coming to terms with his own loneliness and emptiness. It offers a reassurance and a comfort that is illusory and suggestive of things that cannot be therapeutically delivered.

> All too often, hugging functions as a cheap fix for therapist and patient. When the therapist is upset about ending the therapy hour on a painful or unhappy note, worrying how he can let the patient face an entire week bereft of human warmth and, especially, contact with him, then a hug is offered or provided. It relieves the therapist of feeling like the cold, ungiving person implied by the importunate patient. The hug is to be the magic bridge which will tide the patient over to the next week. And it may well do this for a while. I refer to the hug as a cheap fix because it seems to buy great benefits at an inexpensive price. In essence, it is a bargain. The therapist buys off
-Page 235


> his own and the patient's bad feelings at very little expense. But the hug benefits neither supportive nor exploratory therapy and, most importantly, it undermines the goal of competence. It is an example of fostering regression to serve the therapist's caretaking needs. I am ignoring for the sake of this discussion the sexual significance of the hug, but this aspect must also be considered. It is frequently secondary, however, to the need for comfort and reassurance.

> It is painful, but helpful, for patient and therapist to acknowledge that life contains loneliness and aloneness. If one is doing supportive therapy, verbal hugs, in the form of praise or encouragement, are legitimate and helpful at times, although not always. The risk is that here, too, the patient will become dependent upon and work for praise from the therapist. Reciprocally, the therapist may begin to offer praise in order to feel like the bountiful caretaker. Therefore, the role of praise and direct supportive remarks must be carefully considered. There are no simple or universal rules in this regard.

> As therapy shifts more toward an exploratory mode, the hug or its verbal equivalent in the form of praise interferes with the work of processing the transference. The patient's complex of feelings, attitudes, and images of the therapist under such circumstances becomes less reflective of his (the patient's) own dynamics and more in the line of real responses to "real" behaviors of the therapist. If the therapist has behaved protectively, seductively, teasingly, or solicitously, and especially if he is not even fully aware of his pattern, then he is reinforcing rather than examining the maladaptive responses of the patient. Furthermore, the therapist's needs to keep himself from perceiving his own participation in a pathological process forces him to place the "craziness" onto the patient. Therapy ceases to be therapeutic under such circumstances.

> It is impossible for the therapist to keep his or her own personal issues and needs totally out of the therapy situation.
