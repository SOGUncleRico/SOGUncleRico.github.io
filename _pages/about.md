The purpose of this site is to document my self study of mental health, psychotherapy, attachment, therapeutic relationships, anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder, and psychotherapy modalities. Many of the passages posted here have helped me through my darkest times by helping me decipher, understand, and most importantly, validate my feelings.
